Amen. Kill jews and continue gazan oppression!"
k70vhew,"Friendly fact reminder: Israel has been stealing Palestines land, bombing their civilians, controlling their access to water/food and kidnapping Palestinian civilians for over 50 years. Israel has  been committing genocide on Palestine but somehow people like you like to place the blame on Palestine. If you think Hamas is bad, I have some bad news about the IDF for you."
k70ve4h,"Well, i would never support Hamas, but there actions Israel could do that would make me stop supporting it: State orginized killing of Israeli or west bank Arabs or use of Atomic weaponary."
k70vaxh,"There is absolutely evidence of Hamas taking Captagon - a drug similar to Pervitin, which the Nazis took - and it‚Äôs been reported by multiple outlets.

k70vaqe,Do you have the avtual link to the new york times? Because I looked at it and they said hamas didnt give them any evidance. All of of this is just lies
k70v9yk,"I didn't deny anything you said.

I said Israel doesn't use human shields and Gaza does. Which is a fact.

You chose to change the subject to Israel having locals in Gaza deliver messages for them years ago. The behavior you're complaining about ceased.

So what was the point of bringing it up when I said Israel doesn't use human shields and Gaza does? Just as a distraction?"
k70v865,"&gt;Yes, exactly, Hamas attacked, not the 1 million kids in Gaza. No amount of capslock or invoking of October 7th is gonna make murdering kids ok

Which makes all of that Hamas's fault.  EVERY death since October 7th, by bullet, bomb, every single kid who dies, is Hamas's fault.

That's why in the United States if you're part of a 3 person bank robbery, every person who dies is a murder that is on your hands.  Even the 2 other people who are with you, if they get shot by a security guard, that's a murder charge for you, because you're the one responsible for everything that happened as a result of you taking a gun into a bank to commit a robbery.

The safety of every child in Gaza was Hama's responsibility, and they willingly put all of those lives in jeopardy when they attacked Israel.  So spare us all the equivocation and acting like all of this is suddenly some evil that the Israeli's are perpetrating on the innocents of Gaza ... Hamas could stop all of this at any moment if they wanted to, all they'd have to do is lay down their weapons, release their hostages, and surrender to be judged for their crimes on October 7th.

If you want to complain about the innocent lives being lost in Gaza, complain to Hamas, because every death that has occurred in battle since October 7th has been Hamas's fault."
k70v6fa,"Firstly, even in the best scenario you are confusing ""Gazans"" with ""Palestinians"", which is particularly disgusting since Israelis are doing unjustifiable attacks on West Bank Palestinians right now.

Secondly, even if we knew that 99% of Gazans support Hamas, it would still be bad to think in this way, because it does not allow for even the possibility of peace without ethnic cleansing."
k70v66s,Oh. I guess since Hamas is putting the children there it must be ok to bomb them? Do you hear how fucked up that sounds?
k70v4fn,I‚Äôm Israeli. Please teach me what I don‚Äôt know about the country I live in.
k70v2m6,"If it wasn‚Äôt on purpose, showing the live and uploaded feeds of 7oct2023?
Many Israelis saw that,what they once fled from, countries one should ask ‚Äò eh buddy, where are your Jews??‚Äô. Not to mention, historical memory‚Äôs. 

What was the thought .. Israel bowing cowing down? That the entire Islamic world would rise like a crusade to Israel ?
The western world just .. looking the other way ?
- what was the goal ? 

I know many approve and liked those vids, like ‚Äòpay back‚Äô.  More had a .. bitter taste. 
I say, a point of no return .. that one step that better not taken, was taken.

It‚Äôs now 2023, there is no room anymore  for this 
1980 terror stuff. 

Europe/EU failed, 70.years.
UN failed, 70 years.
Arab league failed miserably even with wars, 70years

I'm not confusing Gazans and ""palestinians"" at all.

Nothing I've said is a contradiction.

Gazans and people of West Bank absolutely did not think of themselves collectively as ""palestine"" in 1949-1959. Your position is clearly a lie."

Still not convinced ? [Go read the UN report linked at the bottom of this page.](https://archive.crin.org/en/library/publications/opt-un-report-says-israel-used-boy-human-shield.html)

The link I provided earlier was not just about 1 Gazan, it mentioned the Gazan child as an example of the HUNDREDS of instances of human shields used by Israel. They're mentioned in their report. You weren't even able to understand that right, which is why I was sure you didn't read the article for more than a couple of seconds. 

Israel using human shields is a fact. I have provided multiple links and you've acted like an illiterate child. No matter how much evidence I throw at you, you'll keep licking Israel's boot. Discussions with you are meaningless, I'd be better off debating my 12yo cousin."
k70up4p,Ah I see I was reading it was reading it from a world view of sanity instead of a world view of insanity.
k70uoo3,Never let a good tragedy go to waste.
k70uolr,Tell me you know nothing about Israel without telling me you know nothing about Israel
k70undm,"And yet they deserve to be killed by lsrael now?

Why would l go to pro Hamas rally when l am strictly against them? Why can't you understand that both sides have done and do criminal acts?

I am from Northern Europe, and l am observing this mess since a long time. I know both jews and arabs. 

It seems btw that pro lsrael commenters are the aggressive ones here, and very soon out of any legit arguments, then turn to rage"
k70um2m,The Palestinians don't want their own state unless Israel is destroyed too.
k70ulua,"Yes, there has always been a reason why none of the peace agreements are good enough. That reason is because the Palestinian leadership has always demanded full right of return for 4 million ""refugees."" That is a non-starter for Israel because it will result in the demographic destruction of Israel as a Jewish state, which is precisely why the Palestinians have always demanded it.

Honestly, getting into the weeds of the specific conditions in all the agreements and finding excuses to declare them ""unfair"" to the Palestinians is a bit like people arguing over whether 40 babies were actually beheaded by Hamas or if it was just 20 or if they just had their throats slit. It completely ignores the big picture reason why the negotiations have always failed: because the Palestinians have never been interested in peaceful coexistence with Israel."
k70ulhh,"If Israel‚Äôs stated goal is the removal of Hamas from Gaza, there is zero point in making a trade like this. There‚Äôs going to be nobody to negotiate with at the end of their current invasion.  They‚Äôd never say this but I think Israel has already written off those hostages for dead."
k70ulfp,Watch the video. The title is misleading but the person who stole the phone is a Zionist.
k70ujwo,"Show me where this supposed ogrish type footage is, not interviews of people claiming to see them. If Hamas uploaded the videos they would be widespread. I don't have to try to look for videos of Ukraine atrocities. They come up on my page often. But these Hamas beheadings, baby raping, I haven't come across any of it."

k70ufc2,"&gt; Militants freed in the 2011 swap for the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit were involved in the 7 October attack.

So, keep on repeating the cycle then?"
k70uf4l,"I mean they have every right to not want it. That's why they're not giving up, cause all of Palestine needs to be given back to it's original owners. Only then can everyone live in peace. Jews, Palestinians and christians. A two state solution after the displacement of millions of people is pathetic, how are you gonna claim you want a two state solution after stealing the entirety of Palestine for Palestinians to then have only Gaza. No, the entirety of Israel needs to be given back to Palestinians. There's no way around it."
k70uez2,"He shows his colours way earlier:

Full support for Hamas: already a bit wierd, you should be critical of Hamas, they won't lead to palestinian liberation. Actual supporters of Palestine support the Palestinian liberation struggle, which is broader than just Hamas.

""No more Jewish wars"": absolutely brain-dead take, this isn't a Jewish war, it's an imperialist war. The fighting Palestinian resistance recognise that this genocide (and the entire project of Israel) is primarily the fault of the US, a Christian nation. Even ignoring that, it's not a Jewish war, it's a Zionist genocide, Jews also stand against it"
k70udfy,"So, now we're supposed to celebrate the one with the least blood on their hands? 
This is simply unacceptable. I'll never be silent or forget the names of innocent civilians, including children, who have tragically lost their lives. Justifying Israel's actions based on minimizing damage doesn't hold water.

In any conflict, we must hold all parties accountable for actions that lead to the loss of innocent lives and work towards a more just and humane resolution to these issues."
k70udc5,"And rightfully so. 

The deal of a 2-state solution is something no state will accept.

As i said, if israel would be the original state in that piece of land and be forced to take a 2-state deal and then be forced into apartheid i would support the israelis 100%.

Wake up, israel is not a state to be proud of. This can not be a start of a nation of the jewish people, we should know better after 1900 century."
k70ud3p,Yes. Land back for all indigenous peoples.
k70ucop,"if they were to enter a nature party, slaughter everyone around, enter homes of innocent civilians and murder, rape, burn everyone alive.. if they were to kidnap innocent elderly and children, if they were to proudly post themselves doing those things becuase they know they get unlimited support by millions...

k70ubxw,"The Army's Asymmetrical Warfare Group was founded in 2006, so at least that long."
k70ubnu,"I will tell you what propaganda looks like.

Its like denying killing a journalist, and people all over the subreddits of Israel keeps spreading the lie that she was shot by Palestinians.

To finally come to the conclusion that Israel has killed the Journalist and lied about it so that they deny all the crimes when the heat of the moment is at its highest, and then admit doing it when people starts to get over it.

Israel and Israeli media has lied many times before. 

Pro Israelis have lied here in this sub and other subs before.

Propaganda is what Israel is doing. But Palestinians don‚Äôt need propaganda. Your crimes are doing just fine and spreading like fire.

Now Israel is one of the most hated countries in the world. Bravo."
k70ubn8,"Every living former PM except Bennett have openly endorsed renewed normalization of relations with the PA postwar, and renewed interest in negotiating a viable two-state solution."
k70uaqk,"&gt; Are any Jewish people doing this?

Yes. You just don't hear about it because antisemitism isn't as serious as islamophobia.

k70ua1c,"Am I hallucinating or you're actually debating on how should one drop nukes on Israel ""safest"" way possible? It'll result in pretty much with stone and wooden sticks for the entire world, and it will definitely come back for Gaza and the West Bank for the aftermath.

The realistic option is to strike a deal that was similar to the Oslo Accords, but this time around to be bound to it for the 2 parties. Strings attached and sanctions for the party that doesn't follow the deal. That's the only way I see something resolved in their region."
k70u9fk,"No they wouldn‚Äôt. When Israel was negotiating a peace deal in the 90‚Äôs, Hamas tried to derail the process by launching suicide bombings on civilians. When Israel left Gaza and evacuated its settlers there, Hamas attacked the PA, took over Gaza then fired rockets at Israel. 

These people do not want peace"

k70u7vf,"As an indonesian in israel i also found it unbelievable to be. I want to believe there is some semblance of humanity in them but you have to consider that in the heat of that event, with so much rage, mob mentality, drugs(no proof but it is not unheard of), adrenaline you'd be shocked what you are capable of doing.

If you dehumanize these people as filthy zionists(which the residents of most of the neighborhoods were not), jewish dogs than yea I could see them beheading a baby.

I honestly don't want to believe they raped women like we were told but again, there is no law in the hamas' order that says no to thay. They say they abide by islams law(i come from an islamic family im indo). Yet they kill unharmed civillians and therr is video proof of that. Granted not on hamas' telegram but you can clearly see that these are the same attackers that hamas themselves promoted in their group in the ""base attack"" that attacked the civillians."
k70u7fd,"The question should be *‚ÄúHow should the Arab People Respond to the Response of their Governments‚Äù*

The government can‚Äôt do shit without a population of people who let them. 

Arab people have the inherent right as human beings to tell their government what to do, and if they don‚Äôt, to yeet them out of power. 

Although it is a running joke that American individuals own too many advanced weapons that they we sometimes use on each other, the but *reason* we actually have those is because we know and truly believe in our souls that we have every goddamn right to **overthrow our government. 


Step 1. Stop utilizing death and maiming as a first response to conflict. Y‚Äôall have too many very young people that are exploited over and over by a very teeny tiny number of very old very rich people that have consolidated and the control of all the wealth. Death should NOT be the immediate consequence for bad behavior or conflict. 

Step 2. Arab people should force your governments to unite under a banner of ‚ÄúArab Unity‚Äù and put aside internal and external religious conflicts. Again, you have too many young people. Stop allowing young adults to fight. Children should never fight anyway, neither should any Arab from the ages 18-45 right now. If a fight needs to be had, the filthy rich old people who have all the money who use young adult to fight on their behalf should use themselves as fighters and then when they‚Äôre dead, the 18-45 year olds and the rest of the older non filthy rich should take that money and use it for Step 3-5. 

Step 3. Empower civilians through providing an advanced secular universal educational curriculum for all girls and boys that focuses on STEM. 

Step 4. Create an environment of creativity and fund those now educated young men and women to create valuable industries that produce products and services that can both raise the Arab people up economically but also a resource that no one else has to export or trade for valuable imports. *My suggestion* is ANTI-AGING AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY as The West has a whole bunch of old people with a lot of money to spend on not being old, and Arab nations have a whole bunch of young people who have a lot time left on the clock to think of how use that as their advantage. 

Step 5. When one nation is dependent on another for valuable imports that nation becomes a ‚ú®valuable ally‚ú®, and just like magic, that new alliance and their thoughts and concerns suddenly become very important and their best interests become better protected and enforced. 

Play the long game. Not the short.

k70u6ns, I am a sentient menorah.
k70u69a,"&gt; They don't want a two-state solution. They want this to continue until they feel they have enough of an advantage to eliminate Palestine by slowly stealing the land and pushing the people who live there in to smaller and smaller enclaves until they can push them out of their country fully.

Some Israelis want peace and a two state solution. A lot don't which is why you keep getting those illegal ""settlements"" and dead Palestinians in the West Bank when they try to stop them stealing the land."

k70u0y6,"Hamas has stashed plenty of food and fuel in the tunnels to maintain their people for weeks. Ask Hamas to release this food for the Palestinian people. Not just to feed their terrorist soldiers.

The ultimate solution is for ALL Israel being given back to Palestinians, sure everyone living there can still live there, but that land is Palestine, and it will always be. That's why Palestinians have refused a two state solution, cause all the jews that live in Israel aren't even second generation jews.

k70tnae,"Man, you could find all this shit with a simple Google search. It is an anti-Israeli opinion, and a well founded one. Just for that reason, you discredit the information? Israel are genocidal terrorists, the world over.

Part of why Amerians don't want to accept this‚Äîspeaking as an American‚Äîis that America's leaders are complicit with this narrative that Israel is a victim of global antisemitism against Zionists when, in reality, they're actually committing genocide against the Palestinian people. They're not even  Jews. They are Zionisrs. They don't practice true Judaism. Judaism forbids the establishment of a state, and would never condone the slaughter of Palestinian people.

There's no reason to doubt any of these figures. Israel has to sponsor it's murderous ethnocratic military state somehow, and arms sales to other evil regimes is clearly how they do it.

k70tjoj,"&gt;Love giving my chance at free healthcare and education to these thankless nations.

Between Medicare and Medicaid, the USA spent 1.6348 trillion dollars, [as per this](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet) in 2021. The US population in 2021 was 331.9 million, so that's 4925.58 USD per person in *government healthcare spending*.

Canada [spent 5,920 CAD per person in government healthcare spending in 2021.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221125/t001a-eng.htm) At the average exchange rate during 2021, this is equivalent to about 4,725 USD.

I don‚Äôt see why people would think that Hamas, a group that has always called for the destruction of Israel and the death of Jews, would be interested in any peace talks. We know who they are because they tell us, they purposefully crafted the situation they‚Äôre in right now. You can criticize Israel, and there are legitimate reasons to, but leaving out Hamas is naive and ignorant. Hamas teaches that civilians who die killed by Israel are martyrs, its leaders have doubled down saying that it‚Äôs better for them to die in Gaza than live a miserable life, and that Palestinians are willing to ‚Äúpay the ultimate price‚Äù for their ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. This is a group that, when Israel was negotiating a peace deal, launched suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians to try to derail the peace talks. This is a group that, when Israel left Gaza and pulled out its settlers, attacked its fellow Palestinians in control of Gaza and took over, then began firing rockets at Israel prompting an Israeli-Egyptian blockade. They were never interested in peace. 

What they can do is just surrender and save the lives of thousands of Gazans, as well as allow aid to resume. Their continued ‚Äúresistance‚Äù is NOT going to result in an independent Palestinian state, it‚Äôs only going to result in more dead Palestinians and an Israeli occupation. They don‚Äôt care, like they‚Äôve said, Gazan deaths are for the cause so they‚Äôre acceptable."

k70ti6z,"You understand that a slippery slope is literally a [fallacy of logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope), yes? These discussions are only difficult to reinforce with facts, if you choose not to look for them. I try not to form arguments without supporting facts, and to be frank, am not convinced by arguments actively avoiding them. 

All Palestinians didn't participate in a terrorism of 7 October, nor are they doing ""Jihad"". That would literally be impossible. You realise [Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad#:~:text=Jihad%20(%2Fd%CA%92%C9%AA%CB%88h,especially%20with%20a%20praiseworthy%20aim.) is a word approximating ""struggling"" or ""striving""? It's a very broad term that can range from the benign such as a devout Muslim person making an effort to do their regular praying, to the radical such as when Osama bin-Laden called for Jihad against the United States. (Again, please note that al-Qaeda and bin-Laden don't represent Muslims.)

Again, you are making the astounding error of impugning the entire people of Palestine, over vague personal anecdotes. I'm sure there were sick people in every country, who relished the 9/11 NYC attacks. (I'll remind you again that the majority of Palestinians in Gaza aren't even old enough to remember 9/11 or George Bush) There was also a lot of people who showed their support and sympathy to Americans with vigils -- including places like America's current-archenemy *Iran*. Does that cherry-picked example mean Iran is really best friends of USA? Of course not!

I've also seen videos of Americans marching in the streets with sw*astika flags and chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". Does this mean all Americans want a genocide of Jews and hate Israel? Not according to any reliable polling. Not according to the US government giving the all-time highest amount of cumulative aid to Israel.  

I've personally seen videos of hardline Israelis calling for genocide against Palestinians. Does that represent all Israelis? Does that delegitimize the right of the State of Israel to exist? I think you get the point by now.

Jumping to conclusions based on unsubstantiated assumptions and vague personal-anecdotes plays into narratives of hate, and brings everyone involved closer to destruction."

k70tfyv,The removal of settlements in Gaza made the PA look weak as it was unilateral decision by Lukid by not bring them into the conversation nor did they consult them. This emboldened Hamas and helped them gain popularity. Hamas convinced people that they achieved more with violence than the PA ever has through negotiations. There is a reason why the PA have not governed Gaza and are afraid of holding elections on the West Bank. It is because the growing popularity that Hamas has obtained and the risk that they could get a majority in the West Bank.

k70tep0,"The several hundred thousands of original Palestinian refugees have now millions of descendants. When they were originally displaced, hundreds of thousands were granted citizenship in surrounding nations, especially Jordan, but also large numbers in Egypt and in Syria.

A large number of refugees also lived in the West Bank, or as it was called then, Transjordan, which was under the jurisdiction of Jordan, and in Gaza, which was de facto part of Egypt until the six day war. From 1949 until now, even when directly under the governments of Jordan and Egypt, These Palestinians were never granted citizenship, largely because they have instead been used as a bargaining chip by the Arab League to garner international sympathy for the refugee crisis. 

Israel will not allow them to return to where their ancestors were displaced, because now their population has multiplied several times over and if granted citizenship in Israel, have given all indications that Israel would cease to exist and the Jews would be expelled and massacred.

So they are millions of people trapped in a game of political football, and nobody is blameless. There are no easy one-sided narratives about the history of Israel and Palestine.

I don't completely agree with your conclusions though, mainly because it's been proven by history that Israel are the only party who have been willing to agree to a two-state solution. The Palestinians have been offered this multiple times. I also don't think a prosperous and peaceful neighbouring state of Palestine would be a threat to Israel per se; we're always told that oppression is the cause of the violence, so if that's the case then a peace settlement and independence would be the solution, surely? 

But I think there's an unspoken assumption/acknowledgment in your post that actually they would still be looking to destroy Israel. I hope that's not true, but again, multiple failed attempts at peace and refusal to recognise Israel don't make me very optimistic. I still think this is the preferred solution for Israel, it's just looking a long way off at the moment. Bare minimum there would need to be a lot of international oversight and agreements over military capabilities."

At the individual level, it's fine, it gives folks a sense of purpose and fulfillment and as someone non-religious, I have no issue with that. But when laws and decisions are made based off it, from my observation, is when a state begins to crumble, a subset of its society be oppressed, and eventually collapse."

Speaking of transactions, I appreciate that Israel knows that they need the US to give them billions in welfare checks every year, so when we tell you all to make sure the Gazans have water, you bend the knee and turn the water back on.

It's only going to get better because the boomers are on the way out and an October 11th poll showed that millennials and Gen Z have minority support for Israel. As millennials and Gen Z become more and more powerful, Israel will lose more and more welfare. Good luck!

edit: Also, you're probably going to get in a war with Iran and you can't shut their water off. You'll beg the US for help because Iran has ten times the population as Israel, but there will be no support in the US to send troops to help you fight that war. You all will beg and I'll just be sitting here saying ""The transaction has become fruitless."""

It is important for both parties to understand each others fears and concerns.

The Russian government has postured towards Israel, but a lot of marching orders were not. My dad escaped the USSR and on-the-grounds personnel were notoriously anti-Semitic. Still, they‚Äôd gaslight rhe population and say ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs rough here, but going to Israel is *way* worse, trust us‚Äù. So people stayed and were forced to quarter Russian military members to show their gratitude (feed, provide lodging, spare cash, etc.).

k70s5aa,"&gt;The current Israeli government doesn't. They've offered multiple two-state deals that were flatly rejected.

This just isn't a factual statement.

The first crucial steps in normalizing diplomacy between the PA and Israel were undertaken by Fatah and the Israeli Labor Party in 1993 - but they were put on hold after Netanyahu won office following the assassination of  Rabin in '95. Coincidentally, some of Netanyahu's campaign stunts included posters with images of Rabin in a set of crosshairs, and a mock funeral procession where pallbearers shouted ""Death to Rabin!"" while parading around a casket with Rabin's image posted onto it. Netanyahu was even made aware by Israel's security chief that there was a plot to kill Rabin, and was asked to please tone it down. *He refused.*

Fortunately, he wasn't in office very long the first time around, and negotiations were reopened under Ehud Barak.

The 2000 Camp David summit saw both sides being willing to make major compromises, but not enough to bridge the gap. There's plenty of blame to be placed on both Israel and the PA for the failure of the Camp David summit, though it's telling that Barak's Foreign Minister (who was present for the accord) stated that ""if I were Palestinian, I would also have rejected Camp David.""

But that wasn't the end of the peace process. They continued to meet and negotiate, with both sides proving willing to make even more concessions on what had been previously un-negotiable maximum demands, and by 2001 at Taba were *just about* to sign a viable, mutually agreeable two-state treaty.

But then Ehud Barak's term ran out, and the Likud party swept into office once more - and, once more, scrapped the plans and shut down negotiations.

The PA has, since '93, been extremely interested in finally coming to a negotiated settlement - much to its own detriment, as Palestinians become increasingly frustrated by the Israeli Right refusing to meet this diplomatic tack in good faith. They've not had a partner willing and able to meet with them for good faith negotiations in the Israeli gov't since 2001, though - and the Likud policy of seeking to consistently delegitimize and destabilize the PA is a major part of why we've arrived at the crisis we currently find ourselves in."

* In 1947 a two state plan was proposed and accepted by most Jews, but was rejected by the Arabs. The Arabs then launched a multi-nation invasion of Israel.
* The Armistice agreement of 1949 left a large amount of land in the possession of the Arabs, but instead of forming an independent Palestine, they decided to set up refugee camps/organizations and keep the Palestinians stateless.
* In 1967, the Arab nations attacked again, and lost a significant amount of land. Israel gave back most of the land, but the Arabs still did not establish a state of Palestine.
* In 2000, in the Camp David talks, the Palestinians were given a new two-state proposal which they again rejected. They then launched the Second Intifada, fairly similar to what's happening now.

k70r8g0,"1. Heavily depopulated is a Zionist myth. It comes from the phrase ‚Äúa land without a people for a people without a land‚Äù there were arabs living in this region of Palestine which had been an Islamic country for over 1300 years before the British. A simple look into the ottoman registry called the Nufus. The ‚Äúunderpopulated‚Äù myth is blown up by the discussions of early Zionists, such as Chaim Weizmann, who when asked about the inhabitants of Palestine responded with: ‚ÄúThe British told us that there are there some hundred thousands negroes [Kushim] and for those there is no value.‚Äù.

2) the Jews weren‚Äôt promised ‚Äútiny bit of silver from a big land‚Äù. The belfour declaration showed intention to make Palestine one big Jewish state. Also why did you conveniently leave out the two state solution would be giving land not owned by the Jews to the Jews, including the best and most fertile land in the region along with most of the ports. It was a ripoff from day one and arabs were in their right to decline it

3) ‚Äúthe Palestinian identity was there wayyyyy before 1967. You‚Äôre using typical colonial arguments used against indigenous people in order to minimize their claim to the land. Take for example national identities such as ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù or ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù. These national identities are very recent, barely coming into existence at the end of the 1800s. Yet, nobody claims that Germans or Italians are a ‚Äúfake‚Äù people, despite their national identity not existing 200 years ago. Throughout history, peoples have often changed how they identified politically. The Sardinians eventually became Italians, Prussians became Germans. That doesn‚Äôt give you the right to say Palestine and palestinians didn‚Äôt exist so land theft is acceptable‚Ä¶

4. ‚ÄúYes they owned some of it but they didn‚Äôt govern it‚Äù because the Zionist British refused to give the indigenous Palestinians their own government. They helped overthrew the ottomans (which u fail to mention) in promise of their own recognized nation- just for British to refuse them government and bring in Jews in hopes of making Balfour declaration come true. Just because they weren‚Äôt allowed to have a government after the ottomans left doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt deserve to be in power.

5. The British were not ran out by arabs. Yes arabs were fighting zionists but in 1947 the zionists were fighting both arabs AND the British. 

6. To be clear, UNGA resolution 181 simply did NOT partition Palestine. It was only a partition plan, which was to be seen as a recommendation, and that the issue should be transferred to the Security Council. Israel was unilaterally declared by Zionist leadership in may 1948 by force while the Security Council was still trying to arrive at a conclusion. The plan was never implemented. And even if it was, there is nothing in the UN charter that confers such authority to the United Nations. So this means israel was created through conquest, which has been illegal since 1945. 

7. ‚ÄúThey agreed to share the land while colonial arabs disagreed‚Äù COLONIAL NATIVES YOU SAY?? It is unanimously agreed upon that the Jews are settlers and that Palestinian arabs are the natives of the land. This is how the British, the UN among others legally define these terms. Also- if arabs are the ‚Äúcolonialists‚Äù (who‚Äôve been the majority of the land for milleniums)- how many immigrated there??? How many Jews were in Palestine before the mandate??? Less than 50% of the population, the VAST majority of whom just immigrated, wanted half the land. the arabs have a legal right to refuse this. 

8. Not every country disobeys international law even tho international organizations favour Israeli interests over the internet‚Äôs of the native Palestinians. Not every country conquers another after conquest becomes illegal. Not every country was founded on genocide and ethnic cleansing"

- Jews in the region weren‚Äôt entirely Arab.

You see because a large number of Jews in the region were actually expelled from Europe and resettled into the Ottoman Empire. They lived, prospered and were quite wealthy even in comparison with the natives.

A quote from the article:

""At the same time, Egypt says a mass exodus from Gaza would bring Hamas or other Palestinian militants onto its soil. That might be destabilizing in Sinai, where Egypt‚Äôs military fought for years against Islamic militants and at one point accused Hamas of backing them.

Egypt has backed Israel‚Äôs blockade of Gaza since Hamas took over in the territory in 2007, tightly controlling the entry of materials and the passage of civilians back and forth. It also destroyed the network of tunnels under the border that Hamas and other Palestinians used to smuggle goods into Gaza.

1. First off, WW2 predates Geneva Conventions and was extremely brutal for civilian populations. The French Resistance knew this and still tried to separate themselves from civilians as much as possible when they carried out their attacks. Still, it would not have been a war crime under the GC for Germany to cause collateral damage attacking the French Resistance. Using human shields and hiding among civilians is a war crime. Collateral damage among those civilians isn't.

2. If Hamas fires laser guided bombs, they can easily attack that building and only that building. That is what Israel does. Unfortunately for Palestine, Hamas hides their war assets in civilian buildings like hospitals (proof above) because they want as many civilians dead as possible because that's bad for Israel 

These tactics are very clear. It's crazy how so many people think you can rape and murder whoever you want as long as you hold your own baby up in front of you after.

Point taken. However, drawing direct parallels between these histories and the Israeli-Palestinian situation oversimplifies the unique circumstances and timelines of each.

While we can acknowledge historical wrongs globally, it's crucial to approach each situation in its context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is relatively recent, with many of the displaced people still alive today. The immediacy of the pain and ongoing nature of the conflict makes it different from cases where the colonized or displaced populations were integrated, marginalized, or eradicated centuries ago.

Acknowledging the historical context of other countries shouldn't preclude us from striving for justice and peaceful coexistence in the present-day Israeli-Palestinian context. The goal should be to learn from history and seek solutions that prioritize human rights and mutual respect."

Israel puts the number at 20 to 40k.  Arabs put it at 700k.  But no one puts it in the millions.  Note 750k jews were expelled from middle eastern and north African countries in the years that followed the founding of Israel.

No one was moved into Gaza. Zero. Gaza was under Egyptian control from 48 to 67.  The population grew yes, but not by putting people into it.

Gaza was under Israeli control from 67 to 2005.  And again, no one was out into Gaza.

Gaza is almost 200 Sq miles.  With 2 million people in it, meaning it's 1/10th the density of Manhattan. 

Not a camp. Not a prison.

Palastine is a colonial name. Invented by the Roman emperor Hadrian .  There wasn't any palastinian kingdom , state or country in the history of the world . The Palestinian flag is the pan arabist  of the bhattist party .  Arabs. Didn't identify as palastinians until 1964 , they identified as Arabs or either Egyptians  , syrians , or jordenians to be more specific . 


&gt;and naturally a Palestinian state would have been established after the end of the British colonization

Accept Arabs refused a palastinian state in 1948 in favor of building a pan arabist state including Jewish owned land in Israel and they kept refusing for indipendece until 1988

&gt;Palestinians didn‚Äôt get that right bcs another occupation happened soon after

There wasn't another occupation

 there was a un offer to give the land both to Jews and Arabs . The Jews accepted and Arabs started a genocidal war and lost . The west bank was ruled by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt who lost it in 1967 to Israel 



&gt;that‚Äôs what am talking about they never got the chance to govern themselves


Palastinians absoultly got a chance to govern themselves . They had the grand mufti  haaj Amin El husseini in the 1920's -1950's who  was an Antisemite , a genocidal  maniac , and a close friend of Hitler .

k70q879,"Before Israel, the Jews were not treated well anywhere, there was antisemetism everywhere including the us army(people like George Patton were well known anti-Semites). There was blatant anti-semetism everywhere(neighbours would sell out their Jewish neighbours etc etc). The only area of the world then with high Jewish populations at the time in which large proportions of the non-Jewish populations were NOT ‚Äúanti-Semitic‚Äù as in ‚Äúanti-Jewish‚Äù (\*) was the Arab world. In the only Muslim country occupied by the Germans (Tunisia) Muslims concealed their Jewish compatriots from the Nazis (hence why the Germans could not capture most). Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo had huge Jewish populations since centuries ‚Ä¶ who only spoke Arabic‚Ä¶. and felt totally integrated (in Iraq there had been Jewish members of the cabinet). Furthermore, many Jewish refugees went to Palestine, and got accepted.

Iraqi Jews were coerced by Israel during the Baghdad bombings  


 The baghdad bombings for those of you who don't know:  
 (1950-1951) was a series of False-flag bombings on Jewish targets in Baghdad with the intention to encourage Iraqi Jews to immigrate to Israel. According to Moshe Gat, Meir-Glitzenstein, Samuel Klausner, Rayyan Al-Shawaf and Yehouda Shenhav, there is wide consensus among Iraqi Jews that the Zionists were behind the bombings. This belief was shared among Historian Abbas Shiblak, Iraqi Jew Naeim Giladi, CIA agent Wilbur Crane and the British Embassy of Baghdad. When the 'Lavon Affair False-flag operations (1954)' broke out, Shalom Cohen (Knesset Israeli Politician at a later stage) remarked, ""This method of operating was not invented for Egypt. It was tried before in Iraq."" In a 2006 publication, Yehuda Tager, an Israeli agent who operated in Baghdad, confirmed Zionist involvements in the bombings.

I would also like to point out that it was the Muslims/Arabs who returned the Jews to Jerusalem in the first place after Khalid ibn al walid(RA) and Omar al Khattab(RA) took it over from the Chrisitans, [Roy Cassandra talks through it well in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cL11dps4Y).  


Your notion that the Jews did not have it well before 1948 in the Arab world is wrong, before 1948 Jews, Christians and Muslims all lived together in peace. Muslims even held the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and open its doors every morning and close them every night, it has been described as a ""great honour"" by the 2 families who hold the keys.

and to answer your questions:  
 \- How can people hold onto faith, when it compels to hate:

the value of the whole of hummanity "" That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel

They're not going all in. They can play the victim and get international support from idiots who believe their propaganda. Also, yes, of course Hamas doesn't care for their people. Their main goal is to exterminate Israel. Why would they care about some people dying? The population in Gaza was 1,300,000 twenty years ago. Now it is close to 2,100,000 (genocide...).

k70prt4,"I would like to disagree with the argument that because Israel was supported by rich white powerful people, that it thereby somehow makes it a colonial settlement. Which, will you haven't used the word colonialism yourself, could perhaps be inferree. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Zionist movement required money and global support but that shouldn't make it any less of a ""viable"" settlement in and of itself.

I do agree however, that the British were more sympathetic towards the Jews than towards the Arabs (evident perhaps as an example by the Balfour declaration as opposed to the houssein-mcmahon correspondences). The Brits did sort of try to take a U-turn in the late 1930s but it was clear that they wanted nothing more to do with the region. 

The Palestinians were treated unjustly. There are many reasons that I can expand on if you wish. In part because they didn't understand the importance (ultimately, out of understandingly no need) of forming a national movement for a long time. Perhaps in part because the Zionist movement was created by Europeans whom the Brits found it ""easier"" to trust (look up: racism). In part because of the Holocaust and the guilt European nations felt.

That's not to say the Palestinians are victims and did everything right. But it is clear they hold less power, yet still, no less than Israel, deserve to have freedom and their own country alongside.

I can assure you however, that this is not a matter of who's blame. I'm a historian. I'm also an atheist. And an Israeli. And I don't know if I can bear to live in Israel much longer. I'm saying this, because nonetheless, I do think there is some special need for a homeland for Jewish people; it really is unique and hard to explain. 

I wish we were accepted wherever we went, history and unfortunately even the present (for example the recent Russia lynch attempts) cast fear into being a Jew, simply because I was born as such.

Ultimately, while it is of historical significance there will never be a strict answer of who's to blame. History is more complex than that. It is my perspective however that no one should hold others accountable when it is clear that their plate is not empty. It just doesn't matter. Do you think any problem will be solved if we blame the ottomans? Or the Brits? Oe the Nazis? Or cold war proxy wars? 

Blaming someone else has never done any good to a nation. Look at Germany after WW2, did they blame the Versailles agreements? Or Hitler himself? No, it took them perhaps a while, but they accepted the horrific things they've done, and came to terms with them, and decided to walk a different path while not forgetting the past.

Both sides need to look inside, acknowledge what they have done wrong, and choose to walk a new road, to form a better future. Unfortunately now it seems so unlikely, it truly hurts to say, my heart legit physically aches thinking of the countless civilians that continue to die and will die in the future."
k70prmo,It's funny how quickly the UN loses legitimacy among some people.
k70prnx,"Britain engaged in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence with the Arabs , hinting at support for an Arab-led state in return for assistance against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. However, the exact territorial bounds of this promise were not clearly defined. Then, the British issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917, expressing support for a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine but with the caveat that the rights of existing non-Jewish communities would not be prejudiced.

This dual commitment by Britain ‚Äî first to the Arabs, then to the Jews ‚Äî sowed seeds of tension and conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.   


In1947, the UN proposed a partition plan, aiming to create separate Jewish and Arab states from British Mandate Palestine. The Jewish leadership accepted this plan, but the Arab leadership, feeling sidelined and concerned about the implications, rejected it. This rejection did not deter the Jewish leadership, who declared the State of Israel in 1948, prompting the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

At least 700,000 Palestinians faced displacement, an event now known as the Nakbah. This event deepened the schism between Israelis and Palestinians.

In wrapping up, while the essence of these events may seem straightforward, they're embedded in layers of historical, political, and cultural complexities. To genuinely progress towards peace, we must delve deep into these layers, understanding and acknowledging the nuances of the past."
k70pr5q,"1) Bombing are a precursor to the ground offensive. That‚Äôs how war is waged in every battle. Yes, it helps Israeli troops advance towards the bunkers, command posts and tunnels where Hamas gunmen live. ( Edit: in spite of what you think, no carpet bombing is taking place. Beyond everything, it‚Äôs a waste of munition. Majority of strikes are with precision guided bombs) 

2) The Hamas leaders (not a new approach) live far away in safely. No people should agree to this ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù, but it seems Palestinians have no issue with it. 

3) Why would these leaders call for a ceasefire? I can‚Äôt see even one reason. For them the people are expendable, cannon fodder for achieving their goal. 

4) Only recently (from the safety of his apartment in Qatar, in an interview to Saudi TV), Khalid Mashaal declared that liberty is achieved with sacrifices.  Palestinians (not him obviously) are willing to sacrifice. So for now, he recommends young Palestinians to sacrify themselves. (aka Allah needs Shahids)‚Ä¶ I think it‚Äôs a noble cause. 

Only I‚Äôd change the order: let Khalid Mashaal, Yahia Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, etc, etc, blow themselves first (to show example) and only later others will follow. How about that?

https://youtu.be/gkZDxJ3JhCA?si=mK-l7fdPsyjdTUyI

Edit: even you can understand (if you try) that Gaza is connected with a network of tunnels (a huge expense - with money that should have gone to the poor population). Entrance to the tunnels is often from inside buildings. So they can fire RPGs, machine guns, etc from the top floor of a building, disappear into a tunnel, then pop up on another side of Gaza. All these plans are courtesy of Ayatollah (with love).

Edit 2: There are thousands of Hamas gunmen, assailants, communication officers, suppliers of munitions and food. 

Since the claim is that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù the population, I was wondering who these people are? On 10/7 a mob invaded Israel (the details are well known). But were these foreigners? Japanese? Mongols? Shaolin monks perhaps? No! These are the sons, brothers, husbands, fathers, neighbors of the people they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt represent‚Äù‚Ä¶"

And even assuming there is a way to the solution. I can't see the usual Palestinian demands being accepted by Israel.

But Hamas is the governing authority of Gaza correct?  

Israel has a very long history of targeting civilians, committing war crimes.  The WHO records attacks on hospitals and healthcare workers within Palestine.

For all anyone knows Israel killed many of the concert goers in the crossfire during that initial attack.  Israel could have killed the children with tank shells thats been widely reported throughout the media, there has been no independent investigation by the United Nations.

Its not like Israel does not fabricate evidence, because they do.  They did in 2009 with the al fakhura school.

k70ow37,"Atrocities committed by Hamas against Israeli civilians
I just saw indescribable, raw footage of Hamas‚Äô massacre along with 100 other international journalists, provided by Israeli authorities. Here are the notes I took: 

1: Hamas terrorist screaming Allah Akhbah as he frantically tries to behead a dead man with a shovel.

2: A father and two sons (roughly 7 &amp; 9) running for their lives in their underwear into what appears to be a bomb shelter with an open entrance. A Hamas terrorist throws a hand grenade into shelter, killing the father, and badly injuring the two sons who run back into the house

3: Hamas terrorists enter a house, where a small girl is seen hiding under the table. After some talking back and forth they shoot and kill her as she hides under the table. Hard to say how old she is but looks like 7-9 years old.
4: Hamas terrorists setting fire to a house in a kibbutz. 

5: A beheaded Israeli soldier. 

6: Photo of dead baby and child burned beyond recognition.

7: Scores of dead people on the road after Hamas executed them in their cars. Yelling Allahu Akhbah. 

8: Hamas terrorist calling his parents: ‚ÄúI killed 10 Jews with my own hands. I‚Äôm using the dead Jewish woman‚Äôs phone to call you now.‚Äù The mother says ‚ÄúMay god protect you.‚Äù

So many more scenes but I hope you get the gist. The authorities asked is not to film the screening out of respect for the relatives of the Israeli victims. If anyone has any doubt about what happened, I truly don‚Äôt know what to say anymore.

While that‚Äôs awful (and while antisemitism continues to be awful), it does not excuse colonization and mass oppression of other people. 

If Jews get to steal land based on oppression, why do we not take over Germany who murdered us systematically in the millions? 

I will say this. I hear a lot of criticism about Palestine and other Arab countries being antisemitic, homophobic, racist, etc. But countries don‚Äôt develop socially under artillery fire.

As perverse as it sounds, they actually need us to keep bombing the strip to cover up their poor leadership, corruption and extreme levels of embezzlement, and so much more.

From what I remember, places like Algeria and Morocco had fairly open and accepting practices towards Jews, and many emigrated on their own free will, while other nations had less accepting practices/ outright expulsion of the sephardi. Emigration of Sephardic Jews is overall a spectrum, where there was super brutal repression and more acceptance of them."

But the exceptionalism expressed when it comes to Arabs not wanting to cohabitate with jews is totally absurd. Some Jewish people have done bad things to Muslims. Some Muslims have done bad things to jews, why would the Muslims be any more incapable of living peacefully with Jewish neighbors then the reverse? Drives me nuts. It‚Äôs reminiscent of that ‚Äúsoft bigotry of low expectations‚Äù phrase."

It may take months or even years, but it's clear that this is what the Israeli government wants. Otherwise they wouldn't cut electricity, water and shipments of food and medicine. They know that under these conditions many will die from disease. In fact more people may die from disease than actual bombs.

It's all obvious who did it and was ready to admit that did it. They just gaslighted everyone after that.

One thing that can be sure, the economic difference, and quality of life difference between more religious and less religious communities is staggering, and in places like Tel-Aviv and Bnei Brak, a 10 minute drive takes you from one of the most modern and richest places in the world, to one of the most densley populated, unemployed and poorest cities in all of Israel, actually insane."

Also this is another event that proves that yes, it is often actually about Jewish people and not just the Israeli governments actions or the concept of Zionism. When there's shit like this where people are aggressively looking for , and chasing down people of a specific ethnic or religious group and demanding to see their paperwork for proof they're Jewish or not. When there's synagogues burned down, apartments where jews live having star of davids painted on the doors, Or when the leaders of the groups who fight against Israel keep telling the world that yes they do actually want to rid the world of jews and zionists, it makes it really hard for me to not think there's a lot of people out there with their heads buried in the sand on all this. 

Of course we can and should criticize the Israeli government and the extremists there and in the west bank, without it all being dismissed as Antisemitism. Netanyahu seems to be very unpopular in Israel, hopefully hes gone soon. But it's incredibly naive to think this issue is only about border disputes or the actions of a countries government. There's protests where kids are chanting ""Globalize the Intifada"" and then events like this video where kids are cowering in fear as angry mobs hunt them down for flying in from Tel Aviv .. what year is it?"

For some bizarre reason, the West and the UN seem only to care about atrocities committed against other countries and turn a humongous blind eye to atrocities committed against countries' own civilians. 

This is why H\*tler keeps getting brought up over and over and over again (rightly so) for killing approx 6 million Jews, yet no-one seems to care to the same level that anywhere between 28 - 126 million civilians were killed by the Soviet Communist Party, and anywhere between 40 - 80 million Chinese were killed under Mao, because all of these atrocities were committed by governments agains their own citizens so UN doesnt seem to care. 

Same reason applies to why Hamas has yet to be condemmed by the UN for depriving its citizens of basic essentials like electricity and water. Hamas digs up water pipes that Israel builds in order to supply water to Gaza and uses the materials to build their rockets to fire at Israel, essentially depriving their own citizens from the basic human right to have access to water and the UN is silent as a hawk.

Some deluded people think that the middle east will be at peace if israel disappears but thats just not the case.

Just because I was raised in Israel doesn't mean I ""swallow up propaganda"". You know nothing about me. The most important humanitarian organizations reporting about the situation in Gaza and the west bank are Israeli. Does that mean their evaluation should immediately be dismissed?

Additionally, I think I present a fairly nuanced take on the conflict, so even if you think I'm wrong, perhaps you'll learn something new.


The notion that you're not even going to put time into educating yourself on this subject, but here you are preaching to me, is ridiculous. You don't have to be israeli nor Palestinian to comment on the matter, but you do have to do some research and attempt to understand both sides.

Still, I hope that something in you also wants to listen. I will do my best to address your point.

Regarding your points;

1. There are a lot of racists in Israel, religious ultra nationalists who support the superiority of Jews over other religions and ethnicities. I deeply condemn it. People like Ben Gvir and Smotritch who are in power concern me deeply. Nethanyau is also a racist piece of shit. There are also a lot of racist Palestinians who want to eradicate Jews off the face of the earth.

Unfortunately when you live in a region that is filled with so much tension a lot of radical opinions form. Doesn't mean one shouldn't condemn it. I am doing so, and will always do so, especially against racist Israelis, it is despicable.

2. I'm not going to refer much to the claims of ghettoing or genocide. I've tackled those above. But in short, they are unsubstantiated and completely wrong and are only used to try and paint the conflict as black or white.

3. I suggest you don't compare my suffering with others. This isn't a male genital measuring contest for suffering. The Palestinians have suffered more, and still do, I wrote it already. That doesn't take away from my suffering, and ultimately it doesn't matter. 

The notion that one side isn't suffering enough is ridiculous, if more Israeli people die will that satisfy you? If it were 10000 dead Israelis and ""only"" 5000 dead Palestinians would we be ok and moral?

Don't let your morals be dictated by numbers."

It‚Äôs because the sole source of that accusation was a Hamas statement made immediately after the explosion, and if they had evidence they would‚Äôve shown it (they still haven‚Äôt). 

The article is basically a call to ‚Äúweigh the evidence‚Äù before deciding. The actions of Hamas in the immediate aftermath were themselves evidence that Israel had not done it.

Edit: the media has since retracted the claim because the evidence weighs against Hamas‚Äôs accusation. I‚Äôll post the proof if you need it but Google is also right at your finger tips.

It's well known jews own a lot of banks, oil, finantial system, stocks, exchanges, corporate media, industries in general, and all, and have leverage to make almost everyone silent about it's atrocities.

My point is that the creation of Israel as Jewish majority state would not have happened without white European money and power. So it is in fact a settler creation.   


No, it doesn't change the facts of everything else you've stated. But it does mean that a group of people with less power than the settlers (Palestinians) were treated unjustly for the sake of a Jewish safe haven. I don't blame Jews for being given such an opportunity by the guilt ridden Europeans. I think it's important to point out so that we know who should be held accountable in making things right in this region."

No ‚Äúnationalist‚Äù Jewish historian has ever tried to conceal the well-known fact that conversions to Judaism had a major impact on Jewish history in the ancient period and in the early Middle Ages. Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions. Important groups in the Jewish national movement expressed reservations regarding this myth or denied it completely.

k70kp1t,It‚Äôs troubling that people seem willing to repeat war on terror talking points without a hint of irony.
k70kp29,"&gt; Ukrainians were Nazis though? 

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Ukraine greeted them as liberators because of the horrific abuse they had suffered under Stalin, including a deliberate famine that killed millions.  However, the Germans considered Ukrainians just as sub-human as they considered the Russians to be and treated them accordingly.  Thus Ukraine increasingly turned against Germany--there were Ukrainian partisan groups and Ukrainian units within the Red Army.  That some lingering association with Nazism has survived in Ukraine is not surprising, the same thing has happened in many European nations including Russia itself.  Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Croatia and so on, all have neo-Nazi movements.

However, note that there is a difference between Ukrainians being pro-German when they briefly thought the German army was liberating them in 1941, and Ukrainians actually adhering to Nazi ideology.  Even most Germans were not members of the Nazi Party while that party was in power.  Antisemitism is another issue, the Nazis had little trouble finding local helpers in the nations they conquered when it came to rounding up Jews and shipping them off to death camps."

k70kfa9,"Bibi is NOT Israel. I have nothing nice to say about him. He should be behind bars. This isn't about believing him. He sucks and should be booted. Israelis en mass have been protesting for months to get him out as his underhanded way of staying in government was to partner with tiny extreme parties that together made up enough for a government. The meaning behind that is complex, but the rule of law and adherence to International law and democratic values is something important for Israelis (vast majority - every culture has extremists). The conversation regarding Palestinians has been 2-State solution by everyone pretty much, with terrorist activities delaying solutions each time new ones were proposed or we were making headway.

Bibi is not the source of information. Can I say again how much I hate him? Palestine was a region. It is not an Arabic name - you can verify this easily. The people living in the region were Jews too. There have always been Jews here, since before Islam existed. That is simply faxt you can verify archeologically. You can also verify that it has been held by empire after empire until the British left and Israel was formed. The Muslim Arabs were also given a chance - they refused. 

Arab Jews had since been expelled violently from neighboring Arab countries, you can check out how many Jews lived in each pre- Israel and how many Post. Take a look at those sports teams I spoke about. Look at images of the coins... 

I will give an alternate pov for the boycotts. The boycotts are actually harming Palestinians most and helping Hamas - those were places employing Palestinians, offering them higher wages than they could get elsewhere in Gaza.

The beheaded babies is true, in fact. I wish it werent so. They raped a 15 yo girl then shot her, leaving seamen on her back and her pants down. In her home. American intelligence, as I understand it, verified the atrocities too. And Israeli morgues verifying identities of bodies also confirm. This is what I think Biden is basing his reactions on. They also burned babies and people alive - friends of mine included. My family escaped by a miracle. Israel is tiny, so if you're wondering why Israelis are out in droves trying to prove this happened, it's not a conspiracy, it's people in pain needing the world to believe them, to see them and to treat them as human beings deserving of life. 

I get you being angry about feeling like America is putting Israel first. Having your country putting people outside before the interests of your own is a problem. It shouldnt be. But then... see the other side - Israel left Gaza in 2005. Hamas was elected as their governing body. They created their own flag. Have their own ministry of education and health and so on. They are the ones who reported on the fatalities from the hospital minutes after it happened.They are given billions in aid. And yet, since Hamas was elected it's been ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". If you saw the map of Israel, the meaning is clear - destroy Israel. And if you look at Oct 7, then you know what their plans are for everyone here.

Since leaving Gaza, we have had an increasing amount of attacks on civillians and constant bombardments. Not  media news but lived experience. Each time, the walls around Gaza and the restrictions get heavier. Btw, Gaza has a border with Egypt, and they let NOTHING through. So this exceptional pressure on Israel's blockade and only Israel, is causing the rise in sentiment that this is due to antisemitism.

Seeing people chant right now to elliminate Israel especially... it's... I dont actually have words to explain it to you. We are not Bibi. And I promise you, that if you really look, you will find that Hamas is lying. There are such intricate tunnel systems - why no bomb shelters to prevent death? Why no food stores but so many rockets? They dont seem to be running out of those..

And these chants have an effect. And nothing positive."

k70jrnw,"Israel has been on the defense from radical islamic supporters since its inception. So yeah, don't be surprised Israel cages up its neighbors like rabid dogs when their neighbors act like rabid dogs.

But in the end, I don't care. You Start going back to history, you ain't goin to find nothing more than the same old story. Nation after nation conquering each other for that piece of lands for thousands of years.

Israel just happens to be the next one up on the list to claim the land they originally held since the days of Jerusalem. So it is just history repeating itself."
k70jr4d,"""What's getting out of hand is taxpayers of other nations backing va....""

I doubt you pay much if any taxes bases on the level of your intelligence. You have the intellect of a child."
k70jqtw,"Alright.

Sucks to be them I guess? 

I mean Hamas got elected by a slight plurality in 2006 and hasn‚Äôt allowed elections since and maintains their control over aid and resources in Gaza with violence. 

So let those million children die because they played stupid games, huh? Why should Israel let adequate humanitarian aid in? Don‚Äôt they know they won the stupid prize?"
k70jqhu,"Nope, it didn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum.

What is step 2? What is Hamas prepared to give up for peace? I know historically that Israel has been willing to give things up. What about Hamas?"
k70jqb1,"Yes. Every Muslim country is quick to support Palestine with words, but putting money where their mouth is? Nah"
k70jpu2,"&gt;The PLO carried out terror operations throughout the 70's and 80's.  They renounced the use of violence in 1993

Who exactly do you think initiated the Second Intifada in 2000?"
k70jpga,"The UN does not have recognize the legality of the settlements.

The US does not recognize the UN over its own interests.

The US government has never recognized the legality of the Israeli settlements.

These statements are simple truths."
k70joui,This might be the most antisemitic post of the month--and thats saying alot.
k70jog8,of course! tell em
k70joez,"I am not crying, you are just shying away because you can't argue with numbers."
k70jo6h,"Even before 1948 Britain would take land and give it to the Zionists.  They had started putting this plan in motion since the late 1800's.  Even early as the 1920's in the ""Iron Wall"" the zionists write that they must use military force in order to colonize and expel the native population.  Read the history of Zionism, it is a Christian movement from Europe."
k70jmz8,"and most of them, g-d willing, will survive and then be able to enjoy productive lives where they'll hopefully develop even more innovations for humanity!"
k70jlrl,"I literally am not picking a side you utter fool. I criticized YOU for your bald anti-Semitism. I criticized YOU for your trivialization of the Palestinian situation. I didn't criticize Palestine or her people. I criticized YOU in each of the comments however YOU find it hard to take responsibility for the utterly vile things YOU spewed.

If you notice, I haven't criticized Palestine or Israel, because this is not a fucking football match where you take *sides*. This is a humanitarian situation and I'd expect people like you to treat it maturely. However you don't."
k70jl8z,Dumb \*\*\*\*. It has been confirmed that these claims were false. The Israeli army itself said they didn't happen.
k70jknl,"PA + Egyptian, Saudi, and Jordanian forces keeping order in Gaza after would be better than the current situation. Hopefully Israel takes it as an idea. 

No way the West wants boots on the ground."
k70jkeg,"Palestinian population has quadrupled since 1960 so if they're trying to ethnic cleanse them, Israel is doing a terrible job"
k70jkds,"You're absolutely correct and that would be an eye for an eye but it would perpetuate the problem further. We shouldn't want the oppressor and oppressed to switch positions, we should want oppression itself to stop. 

The right thing to do is to not blame all Israelis for their government, many are fighting against the occupation and are being alienated by their own communities for it. A few examples are journalist Israel Frei, codepink cofounder Medea Benjamin, all the staff at B'Tselem and many more."
k70jk0e,"You can clearly hear ""laah illahi laah ila‚ÄôAllah"""
k70jjmr,"Where do you think *European* Jews historically came from? 

You‚Äôre not wrong, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning the region of Palestine has always been a hot point of various cultures, ethnicities and groups over the past 4 millennia from the Cannites, Israelites, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Arabs, Turks. No one group can really lay a direct claim to it as it‚Äôs never been a sovereign nation state at least in the modern sense. That‚Äôs why this situation has been a fuckfest from the beginning."
k70jjcx,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtsKcHmceqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtsKcHmceqY)
k70jiyx,It was clearly a racing incident.
k70jich,Do your homework and try not to skew the two. Zionists deserve every bit of hate they get and hide behind anti-semitism when they get criticized for it.
k70jicm,So you‚Äôre saying indiscriminate killings would equate to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians? Israelis don‚Äôt need to send videos to Palestinian families because they‚Äôre watching it happening with their own eyes
k70jida,I think you sont understand what I said at all. Because what you said has nothing to do with it
k70jia9,"Unsure here if you legitimately don't understand my point or you're just playing an ass. So I'll make it as clear as possible:

1. Israel built the iron dome
2. The reason for the iron dome was relentless bombing from Gaza and occasionally elsewhere

Thus, it is Israel that's been under relentless bombing, for years and years, not Gaza. Note that instead of eliminating Gaza (which they could've done), they opted for a DEFENSIVE system (iron dome). Only after gazans resorted to mass murder of women and children the israelis said ""enough is enough"" and they're finally going in.

As for your ""people in Gaza who are like everyone else"", Hamas is supported by 57% of Gaza's population: https://fortune.com/2023/10/18/ron-desantis-gaza-hamas-antisemitism-israel-blockade-polls/

Hardly ""normal people like you and me."" Unless you support mass murder of women and children, of course."
k70ji6n,Would it make you happy when Israelis will kill all Palestinians?
k70jhp3,"If you are unsure, then go back and read how the discussion started. Educated yourself and then come back with an argument if you need to."
k70jguu,[Russians still are.](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230825-utkin-the-nazi-tattooed-commander-who-gave-wagner-its-name)
k70jgp0,don‚Äôt some arab countries control oil? They can probs do something with that right?
k70jfiu,"They had a chance to have 44% of the land that they had been living on for centuries. 56% would become Israel, despite the Arab population being twice that of the Jews. Is it particularly surprising that they didn't want to accept the proposal?"
k70jezj,"And Jew-hatred is also on the rise and seems more prevalent that islamophobia.
Being so arrogant as to assume you KNOW for a ""fact"" how the majority thinks is in itself problematic, if you ask me. I doubt that ""knowledge"" is based on data but rather personal feeling and again, your projection on others and their actions.
Just because your comment was 100% honest doesn't make it true.
You have no idea about all the reasons people sided with Russia or Ukraine and even pretending to know this is fool's errand. If there's even a single person that sided with Russia out of hatred to the Ukraine, your argument becomes invalid. Only fools deal in absolutes. Nothing in this world is absolute when it comes to opinions (and I'm sure even this sentence has an exception that contradicts it).

""I know my people"" = I believe I know everything and therefore don't need to learn anything new since there is none.
Which in turn means that you're deluded and blind to so many things you can't even count them. Living in your own bubble, protecting yourself from finding out you're wrong.
You're currently a know-it-all. I'd assume you're quite young. You've probably gotten angry at this comment at this point, since I've hurt your self-image. w
With age you might be able to understand things aren't always the way you originally thought they are. Once you're open to be mistaken, many things become not only clearer but also not so one-sided. It might also not come with age. Time will tell.

And regarding the comments... they're aren't the OP's post, they're exactly that: comments. He didn't say anything islamophobic. He didn't use hate speech. He stated his opinion and even took responsibility for it being only an opinion. Unlike you, presenting your opinions as facts, as if they're backed by anything."
k70jdok,"It is, ethnic cleansing isn't limited to genocide. The goal for zionists has always been to drive out the people already living there when they migrated. It was US backed too in 1948"

k70jbbm,Yes.
k70jb1k,"Sure, and Israelis can also lift their occupation and aparthied any minute and I am sure hamas will go with peace after this.

BTW, the blockade in Gaza was long before Hamas took power:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Contrary to popular opinion, Israel did not begin restricting movement between Gaza and the West Bank when Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip, but rather many years earlier. 

[https://gisha.org/project/rose/eng/](https://gisha.org/project/rose/eng/)

and the misreable lives of palastenians living in the WB where hamas has no control shows what happens when palasteniasn throw down their arms. Settlers take their land and kill them at will.

So no, If I were a Palestinians, I would love to die fighting than being killed while armless.

k70j5av,"Yeah but my country also went through the trouble to secure most of their own infrastructure and basic services at the same time. Hamas could have spent less money on weapons and more on improving life for the people in Gaza and chose not to. Now an enemy country they have openly expressed their desire to destroy, shuts off their services? Seems like a Hamas problem to me. Who supplies clean drinking water and aid to an enemy that has called for their extermination? Maybe less could have been spent on weapons and more on... water maybe? How is that Israel's fault?

Israel started selling it, but took the payment from other funding sources that Egypt didn't have access to.

Gaza is filled with Hamas military installations and terrorists. Their mission is to go in to rescue who was taken and to destroy Hamas' capabilities so they can no longer operate within the territory.

The fact the leaders of Hamas are hiding in Qatar doesn't change the fact Gaza is filled with Hamas terrorists and those terrorists are launching attacks. It simply emphasizes that the leadership uses their own as cannon fodder to further their own goals.

The last report released was Hamas had a portfolio of assets estimated to be worth $400 million to $1 billion dollars. The average Palestinian and even average Hamas operate is never seeing a penny of that."

Of course they do. Any country would do the same, as Hamas mostly operates informally, in civilian clothing, and from civilian buildings.

&gt;The Israelis unleashed horror on the 2019 Gaza border protests. The Israelis would snipe male protesters in the balls, leaving dozens of Gazans maimed in that manner. Hundreds of protesters were maimed by being shot in the ankles, knees, eyes and breast areas. Hundreds more were killed

Many if not most casualties were literally Hamas members, some of who were throwing grenades over the fence and sniping Israeli military, again relying on Palestinian civilians as decoys and meat shields.

Nothing Hamas says can be taken seriously. They've been caught lying too many times. I don't put too much stock in the Israeli govt's words either, but at least they're often able to provide real evidence, while Hamas just lies, denies, and films scripted videos for TikTok."

When the British government released the Balfour Declaration in 1917, the reason was to try and keep Russia in the war against Germany because it was thought that most of the Bolsheviks were Jews. The British did NOT control Palestine in 1917. They were fighting the Ottomans with the help of the Arabs.

After World War Two, because of the revelation of the Holocaust, the world was horrified enough to give Zionism the support it needed. The Europeans lost all of their empires but keeping an outpost in oil land became a priority.

Your Zionists ideology's excuse of once living there 2k years ago is what makes it okay to steal and murder your way back is laughable. There's a whole major faction of Jewish people and rabbi's denouncing Zionism and everything Israel has ever done. It's against your own holy book to ever control land again since you lost it in the first place. Read your own damn book

Your state has oppressed , stolen from and murdered the rightful inhabitants of that land for 70 years and nothing they do in return is unexpected or undeserved. 

They will never give up their rightful claim over palestine, and for every Palestinian killed you'll have the rest of their family vowing revenge. You will never be safe there, accepted, or forgiven. 

That land will forever be cursed in Israeli hands for as long as even one Palestinian is left.

So either go full mask off, kill every Arab in Palestine and become a the new Nazi Germany, or pay reparations and go back literally anywhere else"

Absolutely no one thinks rising up and deposing Hamas is either possible or a good idea.

The Israelis would snipe male protesters in the balls, leaving dozens of Gazans maimed in that manner. Hundreds of protesters were maimed by being shot in the ankles, knees, eyes and breast areas.

I don't believe this is revenge. However, I do know that fighting against a terrorist organization that hides between highly populated civilian areas is difficult.
The ratio of Hamas terrorists to civilians is unknown to both me and you since neither Hamas nor the Palestinian health ministry posted how many dead Hamas operatives are between the casualties. I don't say that none of the casualties are people who should not be involved (i.e. innocent people), but I do say that many of the casualties might truly be Hamas operatives.

k70fznx,"That is inflammatory, and very anti Islamic. How can you make such a blanket statement about all Muslims and their countries. Not everything we are told about Islam is correct."
k70fzl4,"They are two very separate issues, despite both involving water.  It's a non-sequitur to point to water pipes being repurposed for rockets when existing functional water infrastructure exists, Israel already limited the flow of water long before this, Israel has extracted water *from* Gaza in the past and enforced control over any Palestinian access to water, and when the population was currently already dependent on tankers carrying water that were halted on Oct 7.  Pipes that are within Gaza can only move water around within Gaza or with its borders, which doesn't mean anything if all external sources are shut off and you can't desalinate new water without fuel.  Or if water is turned on on the Israeli side, but you don't have electricity to pump it.

https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/ This link should probably be shared in every thread like this.

Fundamentally, look at this question.  A tanker is lined up at the border full of water.  Doesn't require anything from Israel.  Why wouldn't they let that in (or Egypt, presumably at their behest)?  That's the dynamic here.  It's not arms, or even fuel, it's just water."
k70fzep,"""I don‚Äôt know all the history of the West Bank withdrawal. But it seems like withdrawal was done with no framework for a peaceful government to take hold. It wasn‚Äôt a good plan""

It was in Gaza, but that aside, it's pretty crazy to me how Israel leaving Gaza didn't lead to peace. That's such a monumental change for the Palestinians and it turned into more violence.

You can criticize the plan all you like, it doesn't change the fact that it showed Israel that leaving an occupied area wasn't enough to lead to peace, and created a significant terror threat. So the WB unfortunately will remain occupied until the Palestinians can prove that won't happen again in the WB.

You're being a little disingenuous there saying they haven't got much in return. Israel offered them the WB, Gaza, parts of East Jerusalem, neutral control of holy sires, and land swaps to link Gaza and the WB. Abbas turned it down.

So you're making it seem like Israel won't work towards peace...but it feels like the other way around given what Israel offered and was rejected."

k70fxpm,Yes but that would require this person to step out of their theoretical vaccum chamber
k70fwr5,"That's a pretty simplistic way to come to a number about how many Palestinians want to ""kill all Jews"" but it's not that far off. I'm sure the number of Palestinians who don't want a Jewish state is bigger than the number who want others to fight Israel, which is bigger than the number who want Hamas to kill all Israelis, which is bigger than the number who would actually themselves kill Jews because they are Jews. Still, in each case the percentage is disturbingly high. 

That being said, People are just products of their environment. Because so many young Palestinians feel this way, that means if you were born and raised there you probably would feel that way too. I really don't know the best solution, but there's a fundamental humanity of each Palestinian that matters as much as anyone, and it's only one generation of different leaders, ideas, government and education between current Palestinian attitudes and future ones of peace and tolerance. (Same is true for racist far right Israelis who want all Arabs killed or pushed out of Israel for good). Again, I really don't know how we get out of this mess, and think Israel has a responsibility to prevent Hamas attacks, but I don't believe we can raid and airstrike our way out of this problem. I worry a whole new group of Palestinians who wouldn't have actively taken up arms will do so because of the war."

And even with modern Zionism, Jews were originally just buying land legally and living side by side with Arab neighbors until tensions began and they began being attacked, forcing Jews to create their own militias and security forces. These things escalated and drove Jews to necessitate their own state. Things could have been different if Arabs back then didn't all sign onto Pan-Arab ideology and antisemitism so easily.

Things can still be different. But it requires de-escalation on all sides and governments that respect their populations, denounce violence, and grant individual freedoms. Yeah right now we don't have that. Hopefully one day. In the mean time all we can do is fight against terrorism and fascism, and at the moment Hamas is the worst perpetrator of this. If Gaza can be freed from Hamas during this conflict then both Israelis and Palestinians will benefit from it. Maybe Palestinians can form a new leadership that is pro-peace. Then the Israeli government will have to come to the discussion table."

Semi-related?
When I was an immature youngster, I proposed to make peace in the Middle East by putting all the extremists from both sides on an island, with free flow short-range weapons.

The bigger problem, is that those left could be like ‚Äúessence of danger‚Äù, full of hate and extremely capable of killing. 

Macabre aside, the problem is there will always be loud, peace-hating fools at either end of the political bell-curve. Usually, they end up there because of belief in lies or ‚Äúhalf-truth‚Äù, so we need lively educational mechanisms to keep bringing those from the political edges back into more reasonable, truth-based paths."

Gaza is what it looks like when they‚Äôre left to their own devices. Billions pour in in aid every single year, and Hamas and the ‚Äúmartyrs‚Äù families are all well fed, while the rest deal with the consequences of their actions. 

It‚Äôs a victimhood machine that‚Äôs run by a death cult who realizes that the best and easiest way for them to continue funding their religious war is to garner global support and aid via the deaths and victimization of their own civilians. 

They do things that directly lead to more people dying and then turn around and point a finger at Israel. The crazy part is that it works. 

You have likely seen all the evidence at this point, but you‚Äôre not arguing based off of evidence, only pure conjectures, and you‚Äôve made it clear that you don‚Äôt feel as if israel should exist. You assume that Hamas will disappear, and the people who were dancing in the streets around dead bodies will magically turn into flower sniffers. 

This is the single most misinformed take on the conflict I‚Äôve seen yet. 

It‚Äôs a direct mirror of the famous quote:

‚ÄúIf the Arab lay down their arms there would no more war, but if Israel lays down its weapons there would be no more Israel.‚Äù

It was first said by Golda Meir and it‚Äôs been repeated countless times. 

However, you flipped it but your version has no veracity. Muslims extremists have been Massacring Jews and any other non Muslim populations that won‚Äôt submit to their religious rule since the first Islamic Extremists existed. 


You‚Äôre so tolerant of the intolerant. It‚Äôs truly perplexing. You think that they share your fundamental values, and they, as a population, really don‚Äôt. The majority of them would vote for Hamas today, the reason being that the PLO is willing to exist with Israel, and is less violent. They want the extremely violent destruction of Israel, a real genocide, but then cry ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù when their actions have consequences. I‚Äôm talking about how they keep civilians packed in known bombing targets, and then point a finger at Israel for the unhinged death toll. They lie about the veracity of the bomb warnings, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, they violently enforce a lockdown of evacuation routes. They even bombed their own hospital and then blamed the deaths on Israel, and you probably still believe them to this day. One side has provided objective evidence (Israel) and the other side points a finger at Israel and screams genocide after having murdered a bunch of their own civilians. 

Most of the war crimes you blame Israel for are just Hamas doing their best to manufacture victimhood. It‚Äôs a product that you and others suck up from your couches, and you can‚Äôt get enough of it. 

Another Hamas defender in a comment early today  put it aptly. They said something along the lines of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to me about war crimes.‚Äù 

You love your comfortable version of being the good guy, so go ahead and post a flag, but remember, you think the people who raped women, burned them alive, executed families including children, executed the bound and the elderly, and discriminately attacked only civilian targets known to be lacking in defense, will just up and disappear if Israel does.

In his address to the Conference, Sharon stated that ‚Ä≥settlements which will be relocated are those which will not be included in the territory of the State of Israel in the framework of any possible future permanent agreement. At the same time, in the framework of the Disengagement Plan, Israel will strengthen its control over those same areas in the Land of Israel which will constitute an inseparable part of the State of Israel in any future agreement.‚Ä≥[14] It was at this time that he began to use the word ""occupation"". Bernard Avishai states that the Gaza withdrawal was designed to obviate rather than facilitate peace negotiations: Sharon enivisaged at the same time annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and the major settlements like Ma'ale Adumim and Ariel which he had in the meantime developed, and thereby isolate Palestinians on the West Bank in territory that constituted less than half of what existed beyond the Green Line.

k70f9ce,"&gt; Does the bombing of Gaza get Israel actually closer to eliminating Hamas?

Yes.

&gt; Are the lives of Palestinian children being lost in vain?

Yes, because they would have been completely safe if Hamas hadn't hidden their infrastructure under their homes. Or better yet, if Hamas didn't intentionally murder Israeli civilians. So in that sense their lives are lost in vain.

&gt; It‚Äôs getting harder and harder for Israel to make the case that it‚Äôs not targeting civilians.

Show me one instance of Israel intentionally targeting civilians. If they were targeting civilians, they wouldn't be telling them to evacuate."

k70f168,"I‚Äôm not trying to be pedantic here (as I do just that), but carpet bombing is inaccurate as it implies a different intention and method of attack. Targeted bombing (even if maximally destructive, leveling of entire blocks, all terrible) is still targeted. Above and below ground targets are being identified and attacked. This isn‚Äôt (or at least, as of the information a publicly available yet, always room for more horror I guess) an attempt to destroy a sector of land, or indiscriminate killing or annihilation. Killing and annihilation are obvious (grotesque) results, but not the operational intention.

saying targeted bombing is accurate. Highlighting the real cost to property, land, infrastructure and human life- also accurate. Using ‚Äúcarpet bombing‚Äù implies a carelessness, heedless and ultimately different motivation. It removes the context, makes discussion of what is happening reduce itself to ‚Äúthey have too many bombs and itchy trigger fingers‚Äù, and this mindset stalls humanitarian relief efforts from being ‚Äúurgent necessity to provide civilian evacuation and necessary supplies‚Äú to being ‚Äústop all illegal and inhuman military operations against Hamas‚Äú with Palestinian civilians being used But not helped.

Nobody knows the character of those Israelis in Dagestan and so i think it's terrible for them to be protesting those individual people that likely have nothing to do with the conflict."

k70esr3,"Wiki said Islamophobia is the fear of, hatred of, or prejudice against the religion of Islam or Muslims in general.

I think the fear, hatred or prejudice against the religion of islam is a legit and acceptable opinion. Because a religion aren‚Äôt people and can hold bad values.

Muslimsthemselves as a whole should be judged case by case.

Having those opinions against islamists who are muslims is understandable. More moderate muslims who don‚Äôt follow the bad stuff from islam should be judged differently."

k70eraq,"First of all it never should have happened. It was an extraordinary intelligence 'failure', if not outright sabotage, for Hamas to breach the most heavily guarded border in the world with a bulldozer and some hanggliders. Netanyahu claimed he had no warning, but after Egypt and the US claimed they had warned him, he deleted his tweet and changed message.

Israel should have responded to the October 7th attack much more quickly and professionally. Reportedly took over 6 hours for forces to arrive. And several of the rave survivors say that IDF was shooting wildly into the crowd and is responsible for many of the deaths.

Now I think Israel should negotiate for all hostages' release, even if it requires releasing all Palestinian hostages, and then demand the UN police Gaza henceforth in exchange for agreeing to a two-state peace negotion process which, if Israel backs out of, it will lose the billions it unnecessarily receives from US and Western taxpayers."

I don't think there's any relationship between being a democracy and being aparthied or not? it's a crime. if you do it then you do it. it doesn't matter if you are a democracy or not!!! how is that related to the subject idk?

The Syrian or north korean regimes are outcast and isn't taking US weapons or US tax dollars. If israel wants to be like this it's fine.

k70em9c,"When, say, the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) undertook sometimes terroristic measures against the *pied noirs*, they at least did so with the aim of independence from French colonial rule.

They want Arab rule ‚Äúfrom river to the sea.‚Äù Even if we assume Israel always has the best of intentions‚Äîand we don‚Äôt need to pretend they do, especially the Israeli the right-wing‚Äîwhat are they supposed to do about the blockade? How do they lift it without surrendering their basic security? Is the international community willing to take Gaza off their hands? It‚Äôs an ugly situation, and certainly the Palestinians deserve to live with a modicum of dignity, but it‚Äôs not politically tenable to expect Israel to roll over.

This is why IMO the international community that supports the Palestinians, but condemns Hamas, isn‚Äôt doing any favors by insisting on a single-state solution. They‚Äôre deluding themselves and screwing over the Palestinians."

k70eiin,You have no idea what you're talking about. Hamas is not an easier force to fight when they are embedded into the population.

k70egpx,Wonder why the world hates you.
k70eg70,"Whew 10/10 to everything you said. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve gotten a good answer for how to effectively express this idea at all. I‚Äôve followed so many global conflicts where people have tried to communicate this in different ways and to be honest, I haven‚Äôt seen anything work. 

The difference with this conflict in my opinion is the change in social media to favor hd video format. That means that the thing that pulls us as humans out of the revenge part of the cycle and into the compassion part (seeing the devastation and the humanity of those involved) is readily accessible. On the larger global scale, people without intense ties to either state are being impacted by what they‚Äôre seeing and that‚Äôs why these protests/calls for ceasefire are so huge. 

With tensions so high among the communities involved, many of the people whose opinions are the most impactful to the situation, hand wave every video of a Palestinian off as Hamas propaganda. What I‚Äôve tried in this subreddit with individuals is asking questions about how reasonable it is to believe that every single video of the devastation in Gaza is fake/propaganda. No clue on its effectiveness though!"

k70e0vr,"Sure I get it, I completely understand valuing life over property and I wish there would be no more casualties but unfortunately those who want to leave are unable to do so, israel has bombed designated evac routes that they specifically told people to use to flee Gaza. Also, why put so much distinction on the efforts of the oppressed instead of condoning the actions of the oppressor, why should the Palestinians bend to the word of the Israelis, it seems so backward that we have to tell the innocent people dying that they need to do something about their deaths instead of telling those who kill innocent people to stop what their doing."

When the ground invasion comes, Israel will destroy Hamas, but not the Hamas leadership. Hopefully Israeli assassins will get to them within the next few years.

k70ciyv,"&gt;Palestine wasn‚Äôt formally declared a country recognized by westerners, but everyone who travelled there called that region Palestine. This is an undisputed fact. Nobody wad callint it israel 300 years ago.

You're correct. Just like Europe is called Europe. Palestine was called Palestine since 132 AD, when Empror Hadrian changed the region's name from Judea to Syria-Palestina in order to erase the Jewish connection to the land.

&gt;Yes Palestine was never a ‚ÄúNation state‚Äù as we know it, but they helped the British defeat their own government/military (the ottomans) in exchange for independence and autonomy. The British backstabbed them and promised the land to European settlers to make independent, then when there were rising tensions, the British demanded the arabs don‚Äôt take independence and wait for the British.

1. The British Mandate of Palestine included the area also known as Jordan, so the Jews were promised only a tiny bit of silver from a big land.

2. The land known today as Israel/Palestine was heavily depopulated. Yes there were people there. But there was enough room for both nations.

&gt;When the British were ran out by immigrant Jewish militias, the UN was in the middle of determining the extent of self determination of Palestinians which is an international requirement if you want to establish a new modern day nation.

The Palestinian identity only came to be in 1964. Roughly a decade and a half after the formation of Israel. Beforehand, the Arab plan for the region was to create a ""Greater Syria"". After the 1948 war, Jordan annexed the West Bank, and Egypt placed a military control over Gaza. Even then it wasn't quite Palestinian land. (Yes they owned some of it, but they weren't governed by themselves).

And the British were driven out by the endless attacks between Jews and Arabs. 

&gt;The Palestinians declined giving away half their land

It wasn't their land. As I've said before. Most of it was empty and ""state owned"" land.

&gt;and the US warned Israel not to declare independence since the UN was in the middle of sorting out the issue.

Hilarious. The UN dropped the matter after resolution 181. And wasn't in the middle of ""sorting out the issue"". Not sure who told you that.

&gt;arabs were patiently waiting for a decision when Israel decided to unlawfully declare independence and immediately started taking half the land before they rightfully were resisted.

Hahaha. The Arabs attacked the Jews the day after the UN resolution was decided, in the Fajja bus attack. The UN never resolved nor did it try to resolve the matter. And the 181 resolution became the de-facto plan. Followed through by the Jews, rejected by the Arabs. 

They weren't rightfully resisted, they agreed to share the land. The Arabs and their colonial ambitions refused and started a war of extermination, wishing to continue the Holocaust in Israel.

&gt;Not a word i said is factually untrue and there‚Äôs nothing relevant that i left out.

I think that aside from the first paragraph about the name of the region, everything else you said was very untrue. You've left a whole lot out, and straight up lied as well.

I literally mentioned that in my comment... there is one snippet of footage that appears in all the articles on the topic depicting one pipe being excavated. We don't know where that pipe was, or if it was even connected to anything. And as I said earlier, it's still scummy for Hamas to be building rockets out of anything, I just think the ""Hamas build rockets out of pipes, better collectively punish everyone"" is a convenient narrative that gets exaggerated in order to avoid thinking through the humanitarian consequences of the situation.

&gt; since you probably didn't even read the article

I certainly did read the article. The whole thing is a hit-piece on the notion of providing humanitarian aid to Palestine, from a paper that has a strong pro-Israel perspective: 

&gt; While the Telegraph cannot independently verify the exact weapons used in the mass bombardment, it has raised fears over whether Western-donated building supplies could have been used to manufacture some of the munitions.

""Raised fears"", ""could have"", ""cannot verify"".

&gt; You want solid verification of this being wide scale? Look at the number of rockets they've launched into Israel- it's over tens of thousands.

This is self-contradictory. How much piping is in Gaza? How much do you think has been turned into rockets? Because if it's on the scale that you're implying they would have had literally no pipes left years ago.

But the point is only casualty per air strike is precision, otherwise there would be like 4.000 killed every day.

First of all l want to make clear that l am against previous and current crimes of both parties of this mess, citizens and leaders. I am not supporting either party, I am supporting reason and justice, and l do fight against double standards. I am from Northern Europe myself, but l have dug deep into this for long and know people from the region. 

The attack of Hamas was totally barbaric. Also the collective revenge on Gaza at the moment is out of proportion and causes damage and death MOSTLY to people that were not guilty in any way.

I have noticed in this sub that fanatic supporters of Israel seem very aggressive and find all kinds of excuses for the collective revenge. Using that logic it would be best to nuke whole Middle East to the ground, who cares if ""a few civilians"" would go along, as long as the bad guys on both sides are destroyed. For people outside the region it would be ok, if we follow the logic. 

When l present this analogy, l see that the fanatic Israel supporters basically explode in rage. It is basically and unfortunately very telling. I am really sad that both Hamas and lsrael see that the only way is escalation.

Even if things are very complicated, there are always better things to do than collective revenge (from any side). If this goes on, the craziness will never stop 

And by the way...even if l am far away from lsrael and Gaza, I see what happens can escalate to affect the whole world. That is why I present this analogy. Human kind does not seem to be able to grow up, and now it would really be needed."

But realistically? That'll just escalate the conflict and more will die. A 2 state solution is best for everyone. Palestinians deserve their own country, and Israel is not going anywhere. Hamas can't rule that new country, it should be democratic.

Now how you split the two countries is the real question, both want Jerusalem, politicizing it and making it its own state like the Vatican is not an option as the attacks will continue, for us Arabs, including Palestinians, a north-south border would fit, since West Bank and Gaza are already north, Jerusalem should belong to Palestine, Israel can have the land from beersheba south.

Jews had a +1000 year control over the land during the kingdom of Israel and the first and second temple before the diaspora.

I don‚Äôt mean to offend, I think ultimately you have a great point- typically called a ‚Äúbinational‚Äù state- some have argued to remove the favored status of ‚ÄúJewish character‚Äù of the country and make a state for the two nations. It is a form of idealism that, with hope, may one day be possible, but it is very far down the road- it would take generations, huge concessions, and ultimately isn‚Äôt a viable solution to current tensions. It also assumes there are numbers enough on both sides willing to concede deeply held beliefs or demands which neither has indicated they are willing to do. Western minds look at divided land, draw more lines and figure ‚Äúthe locals‚Äú were too stupid to come up with a solution- this does not lead to peace.

the most immediate concern (or, counterpoint?) is the reality of intense tribalism. This cannot be legislated out of existence. Tensions between different groups (try to set aside ‚Äùreligion‚Äù as a concept and replace it with ‚Äúsocial group‚Äù) are feverpitched in many places. Though there are substantial numbers in differing groups who are willing to make peace work, they are still not the majority. 

on the Jewish side, a common retort to this plan is the insecurity and imminent danger perceived in not having a ‚ÄúJewish state‚Äù. It has been called ‚ÄúJewish supremacy‚Äù, but I think that is kind of reductive. In essence it is about sovereignty, and the defense and freedom of the Jewish people (I‚Äôm not arguing for or against here, this is just the idea). Many Israelis feel that without a ‚ÄúJewish majority‚Äù, a democratic state will naturally evolve to represent its most numerous, engaged and motivated population. the state could evolve to become a Muslim majority, placing a Jewish minority in a dangerous position (and anyone who denies the danger of Jews as a minority in the Middle East are, well‚Ä¶bless your heart). To argue that Palestinians do \*not\* want a Muslim character to their state is to argue in bad faith and against the clearly stated intentions of a majority of Palestinian voices.

the mechanics of sharing a state involve whatever each side demands-  for Palestinians, I‚Äôve never heard a significant amount of Palestinians urge for less that the right of return, which is roughly 7 million. That‚Äôs a huge influx of people from around the world, mostly currently in Arab countries, and to decline this is a no-go for most Palestinians. It‚Äôs also a nonstarter for most Israelis. Even with a new, guaranteed ‚Äúsafety and representation for all‚Äù constitution, you are moving toward a state of 50% Jewish, 50% Palestinian population, stuffed with suspicion, grievance, anger and political willpower. Maybe tomorrow the constitution says ‚Äúzero discrimination, zero religious persecution‚Äù. Cool. After 4 elections it becomes ‚Äúreligious tolerance and freedom‚Äù. 5 court cases later the Supreme Court amends it to say ‚Äúno compelled action against X person‚Äôs social beliefs. Now it morphs to ‚ÄúMuslim schools vs Jewish schools, fired legally for working on a holy day, manager fires gay employee upheld under new ‚Äúreligious freedom law‚Äù. Jewish landlord successfully argues against providing housing to Muslim family. Etc. over time, this gets worrying. These are all very familiar headlines already.

palestinians would be expected to, over night, accept a westernized culture that many may find uncomfortable. This ranges from public life, modesty, gender relations, lgbtqia+ tolerance and minority autonomy. Daughter went out drinking with Christian boyfriend. Son got high school girlfriend pregnant on the coed school trip.   


land Rights, including redistribution of all land (say 300,000 Palestinian refugees from Akko are returned next month (some from camps in Lebanon, some from Gaza, some from West Bank)- all dropped into Akko tomorrow. Logistics are intense- living arrangements, jobs, are there enough apartments? Did the family who owns the building agree to any property rights sharing? Will someone from a Lebanese camp feel comfortable paying a Jewish landlord? There is just so much involved in just this one scenario that could take years to hammer out. It‚Äôs just one city.

what about reparations? Will there be an agreement based on land lost in 48? How does one prove their entitlement to it? A national ‚Äúreturned peoples fund‚Äù (This is actually a reasonable solution, but funding and disbursement is a nightmare).

what about social conflict? After years of violence, is it fair to expect either group to be comfortable sharing buses? Is it unreasonable to expect, at least for the first, say, 10 years, breakout violence? Will the majority agree to just let the final dregs of public killings, escalating fights leading to stabbing, disagreements and self segregating, the occasional bomb on an ambulance- will they just agree to ride those out? Each flare up will spark another.

The land was purchased, gangs of Muslims started killing Jews, so the jews reestablished their country and kicked out the hostile occupiers. But still 2 million Muslims live in Israel, where are the Jews in the rest of these Muslim countries? No one talks about their ‚Äúright to return‚Äù.

k70b2rr,"At this point I think the point for Israel is to make it absolutely clear to everyone that they should be terrified of the prospect if attacking Israel and harming its people. There's revenge here, certainly, but also to prove a point. It seemed to work with hezbollah a few years ago when Israel did massive damage to Lebanon, which is thought to be a major reason hezbolla won't get involved past a few boarder skirmishes. They don't want to get flattened again.

They just stormed an airport in Russia that had nothing to do with anything, assaulting and ripping peoples wallets from their pockets demanding to know if they‚Äôre Jews. There is no way any sane normal person can connect that to Zionism or Israel. That is pure unadulterated mass racism. In an awful, awful way I‚Äôm kind of happy that these heinous terrorist Palestinians are foaming at the mouth publicly ranting and assaulting, because people see what they are now.

k70b1pl,"This is a very thoughtful response that still manages to acknowledge the humanity of your ‚Äúenemies‚Äù.

It‚Äôs pretty much most of what supporters of the Palestinian people want: recognition of the humanity of Palestinians. 

Humanity means that like any other group of people they‚Äôre fallible, not monolithic, and because of that, the population still deserves a right to life. 

Of course you felt relief at the start when you saw Israel struck back, most humans would in the face of a heinous terrorist attack. There‚Äôs no fault in that. A lot of Americans felt the same in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Much less Americans feel that way about it now with the gift of hindsight. 

But what stands out with your viewpoint is that it gives us room to recognize that as much relief as you got from seeing this strike back in the beginning, the devastation of the strikes are horrifying. And we know that when a population experiences something truly horrifying, something that makes them feel unsafe and causes their whole body to enter survival mode, they‚Äôre likely to feel relief when their side strikes back.  

That‚Äôs not a cycle we should want to perpetuate and discussions like the one you started here will go a long way in disrupting that cycle. Thanks for sharing! I hope you and your family/community stays safe throughout this violence."

If the working class of Ireland or any country seize control of all the wealth they produce, they can force demands and cut the Israeli economy and send resources to Gaza as well as those starving in their own nations.

The fight is fundamentally the same in every country, it needs to be expanded and deepened into a fight for socialism to overthrow global capitalism, which has once again made its agenda global war and austerity. The working class has no country, however it is linked internationally through the economy. The Irish economy completely cutting itself off from global capitalism will destabilise every country, and be the impetus for class struggle around the world, just has the recent events in Gaza have caused an upsurge around the world.

I am from Northern Europe myself, but l have dug deep into this for long and know people from the region.

I have noticed in this sub that fanatic supporters of Israel seem very aggressive and find all kinds of excuses for the collective revenge.

Good job Thailand being awesome. 

I never expected a South East Asian country to be one of the shelters for Jews in a time of need, but you protect them they remember their history more than most religions/ancestrys and pay back the favor. In 2004 a horrible tsunami effected Thailand and the local Jews and Israel state sent massive relief to the mostly Buddhist nation of Thailand. And when Jews from like Israel or America decide to visit/tour South East Asia they can find a small community to engage with.

k70ad48,"&gt;I don't think the Palestinians were all that serious either.  One of the reasons I never considered the 2SS all that viable.  Any 2SS would either be horribly opposed by one side or majority opposed by both.

I disagree but my issue is specifically with Likud's fundamental lack of interest in a serious 2ss regardless of how willing Palestinians were. If all Palestinians suddenly became complete moderates who would be completely happy with a Palestinian state including the West Bank, Gaza strip and at least parts of east Jerusalem, Likud wouldn't be interested.

&gt;The Israeli right doesn't talk in terms of ""right to the entire region"" in the sense the left does.

I mean the original 1977 party platform of Likud literally states:

""The Right of the Jewish People to the Land of Israel (Eretz Israel) a. The right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is eternal and indisputable and is linked with the right to security and peace; therefore, Judea and Samaria will not be handed to any foreign administration; between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.

b. A plan which relinquishes parts of western Eretz Israel, undermines our right to the country, unavoidably leads to the establishment of a ""Palestinian State,"" jeopardizes the security of the Jewish population, endangers the existence of the State of Israel. and frustrates any prospect of peace.""

From the 1999 party platform you used an excerpt of above:

""The Jordan river will be the permanent eastern border of the State of Israel. The Kingdom of Jordan is a desirable partner in the permanent status arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians in matters that will be agreed upon.""

&gt;I think it will. What happened to Normans, Aquitaines and Burgunians?

I'm not very familiar with that history. What policies applied to these people do you think can also work with Palestinians?

My argument has a lot of solid backing, despite multiple attempts at ignoring and trying to diminish the political issues involving Palestinians it always came back to bite Israel eventually in a cyclic pattern. I'm not even sure what your proposal is, unless theres some form of actionable plan similar to what was applied to the groups of people you brought up, which so far seems to be just ignoring them or in essence just the the status quo, it will result in similar results again and again. Some time in the next few months or years we'll be talking again about how upsetting 'the cycle of violence' is.

Israelis and pro-Israelis would rather pursue oppressive policies that have been tested and failed over and over again rather than bother having discussions centering around Palestinian rights because having your cake and eating it too where Israelis get maximum comfort for as little concessions as possible all at the expense of Arabs is at the heart of Israeli society and is probably one of the more repulsive things about their society honestly. They want to uphold a pseudo-liberal-democracy while controlling virtually the entire region but only apply these democratic principles for a select portion of the people in the region while leaving millions of Palestinians as poor disenfranchised residents under direct or indirect oppressive military rule. It's like at least try picking between a genuine good-faith liberal democracy and the whole land, whats with pretending Israel has both?

&gt;Remove the systematic supports for Palestinian nationalism and Palestinian becomes an ethnic not a national identity. Go further and it becomes part of the ethnic background of Israelis, a historical features.

Okay, how do you plan on doing that?

&gt;You mean like what is happening with Israeli-Arabs as they are entering the middle class.

The Arab-Israeli middle class is comparatively small to the Jewish middle class. I'm not sure that would always be the case with West Bank Palestinians in the mix in whatever political framework is being imagined.

&gt;To be middle class generally requires a lot of assimilation. A society can tilt the field so that is even more true. An assimilated middle class demanding rights doesn't endanger the system it strengthens it.

Okay, I'm not even sure what political framework all this happens in, but if we're talking about a form of a traditional 1ss what happens when the millions of Arabs in the west bank start breaking into the middle class still clinging onto Palestinian or Arab nationalism? Unless you propose to ban people from entering university if they hold certain political beliefs like supporting of a 2ss or giving special taxes people with 'unorthodox' opinions how will you protect against a strong nationally conscious Arab middle class?

&gt;When the Irish demanded rights or later when blacks did it made American more in line with its ideals not less. When a Zionist ethnically Palestinian middle class demands rights it makes Israel more not less Zionist

The issue you're missing is that they might not be Zionists. They might just be members of an ethnically Palestinian middle class demanding national rights and a state. You can either avoid it or establish a society using non-democratic means to subvert this.

&gt;They were friendly neighbors in the 1950s and 60s. Then they started mixing for 2 generations and everyone is just Israeli. Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, especially among the non-Haredi population are ceasing to exist as distinct populations.

My argument there was more of a semantic one but in regards to this ashkenazi and mizrahi jews have far more in common with each other than arabs and jews.

&gt;We disagree. I think you are dead wrong on this. Read some of the classic right.

What do you consider to be 'the classic right'?

&gt;Don't see it. If anything he is arguing the opposite. The enemy aren't idiots. They aren't going to sell out their interests cheaply or easily...

Correct. The racial superiority in question is in regards to the belief of innate moral superiority of the jewish cause over whatever the Arab cause or demands were.

&gt;Don't confuse racist with desiring to win. Napoleon wasn't racist against the Germans, British and Russians.

I'm not confusing them. I think they're fundamentally tied, yes he had a desire to win in establishing a maximalist Jewish state whatever the cost may be on the Arab end. He was letting his ethnic bias leak through to his policy decisions. The policy he was trying to win in enforcing reeks of racism. Napoleon may have not believed Germans were merely intellectually inferior backwards pseudo-civilization types but regardless he had no problem bastardizing the holy roman empire into a series of French client states at the expense of Germans or whatever aspirations they had or were going to have for the benefit of French imperialism."

k70a58b,"On double standards, collective punishment and ""logic""

First of all l want to make clear that l am against previous and current crimes of both parties of this mess, citizens and leaders. I am not supporting either party, I am supporting reason and justice, and l do fight against double standards. I am from Northern Europe myself, but l have dug deep into this for long and know people from the region. 

The attack of Hamas was totally barbaric. Also the collective revenge on Gaza at the moment is out of proportion and causes damage and death MOSTLY to people that were not guilty in any way.

I have noticed in this sub that fanatic supporters of Israel seem very aggressive and find all kinds of excuses for the collective revenge. Using that logic it would be best to nuke whole Middle East to the ground, who cares if ""a few civilians"" would go along, as long as the bad guys on both sides are destroyed. For people outside the region it would be ok, if we follow the logic. 

When l present this analogy, l see that the fanatic Israel supporters basically explode in rage. It is basically and unfortunately very telling. I am really sad that both Hamas and lsrael see that the only way is escalation.

Even if things are very complicated, there are always better things to do than collective revenge (from any side). If this goes on, the craziness will never stop 

And by the way...even if l am far away from lsrael and Gaza, I see what happens can escalate to affect the whole world. That is why I present this analogy. Human kind does not seem to be able to grow up, and now it would really be needed.

What happens now is far from ""precision"""

When the British were ran out by immigrant Jewish militias, the UN was in the middle of determining the extent of self determination of Palestinians which is an international requirement if you want to establish a new modern day nation.

k7094h2,"This systemic attempt to use loaded words when discussing Israel constantly horrified me.

A simple example is ""apartheid"", a term originally describing racial segregation in South Africa and Namibia, a term that has been appropriated cynically to describe Israel, and only Israel, despite many other countries having far clearer examples of ""apartheid-esque"" characteristics; look Turkish treatment of Kurds, Chinese treatment of Uyghurs etc.

The claim ""genocide"" has 0 basis. The claim that Israel is bombing a city indiscriminately has no basis whatsoever. Genocide has actually a strict legal definition, you can look it up if you want. 

The claim ""white European settlers"" is perhaps the most insulting. Most Israeli jews are of Mizrahi descent (meaning Middle Eastern or North African), most Israeli jews are refugees. 900,000 Mizrahi Jews immigrated as a result of as you like to use that word so much, ethnic cleansing. Other Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, have mainly immigrated as a result of pogroms in Eastern Europe or the Holocaust. 

The hate for Jews throughout history is crucial to understand if you truly want to understand this conflict, Zionism, the establishment of Israel.

Personally, I think that your view is extremist and ridiculous. If Native Americans demanded their homeland back today, took up arms and went to claim it with force would you let them kill you? If you've said yes, in order to have some twisted sense of moral consistency, I can assure you that you wouldn't. It is especially simple to criticize other people fearing for their lives when you don't have to fear for yours.

Crimes committed by your forefathers should have no bearing on your future, likewise, crimes have been committed by Israeli Jews against Palestinians, there is no way around it. Some crimes are still being committed. I condemn the treatment of Palestinians in the west bank. The Nakba is rightfully a tragic event, but two wrongs don't make a right. Crimes of ethnic cleansing being committed nearly a century ago doesn't justify ethnic cleansing of 8 million people today. 

The notion that Israel has no right to exist is not only racist (as, even if not considered antisemitic, Israelis can also be described as an ethnic group) it is also stupid, plain stupid, and impractical. Israelis have no home to return to. Israel was established so that most of them have one. Will (probably about, an approximation) 4 million Israeli Jews of Mizrahi descent go live back in Syria, Turkey, Iraq?

Some Jewish communities have existed for thousands of years in peace with Muslims but were forced out. 

Israel isn't an ethnostate, as all citizens have equal rights. The only difference is the right of return for Jews and establishment of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people. This doesn't classify as an ethnostate, considering that again, all citizens have equal rights and ethnostate is by definition ""a sovereign state of which citizenship is restricted to members of a particular racial or ethnic group"".

Also, just to be technical, since you care so much about it, Hamas technically committed crimes against humanity, which is different from war crimes in their definition.

The west doesn't, but it should, differentiate between Gaza and the West Bank, the situation in each is completely different.

All of these words, all of these labels, all of which are either inaccurate or incorrect do the entire world a massive disservice. Because they don't intend to further discussion.

If you have no empathy for dead innocent civilians, wherever they are in the world, you should take a deep look inside and reevaluate your values and what you stand for.

Last but not least, people often like to paint this conflict as ""oppressor vs oppressed"", ""good vs evil"" (from both sides), ""victim vs perpetrator"". All of these are an attempt to simplify what is a complex conflict, it is people's lives.

Palestinians suffer more from the conflict than Israelis do, there's no way around it. That doesn't justify Israeli suffering. This conflict is not simple. I don't care about the twisted TikTok algorithm you've spiraled into or whatever, these are people's lives that people all around the world but especially in America, just love to oversimplify.

k70912u,"Frankly, they have done a lot during this that should be cause to switch sides.

Using white phosphorus in populated civilian areas? When they consistently say that Hamas are hiding underground, so how will it even hurt them? But it does hurt innocent people, and it‚Äôs a war crime.

Cutting of access to basic human essentials, water and food? And blocking their access to any humanitarian aid? There are babies, children and pregnant women and elderly people, and sick and disabled people. Another war crime. How can that be justified just to ‚Äúfind Hamas‚Äù?

Bombing UN schools and UNWRA warehouses? Not acceptable. Bombing churches? Another war crime.

All of the above things risk the lives of the hostages that were taken, and people are desperate to get home safely. Surely all these things could kill some of them if not all of them at some point?

Hamas did terrible things, that‚Äôs not disputed. But Israel‚Äôs government, and military are clearly punishing innocent civilians for the crimes of Hamas. And that‚Äôs disgusting.

Palestinians deserve the right to live on their own land. They deserve peace and safety too.

k708yq4,My question exactly. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get so much hate on this post- if only ppl googled the true history.
k708yn4,"Again you are looking at it wrong. What is the goal of keep doing it?

Since we left Gaza 2005, it's not our responsible for the water of Gaza. They had plenty of clean aquifers to pull from, and the UN and Israel supplied them with the infrastructure to pump water from them. But after Hamas took over, they removed most of the pipe to create rockets from (and it's something we blame them of doing, it's something they proudly [posted videos about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvvqBcA-9yA)), and used the remaining pipe for both clean water and sewage.  
The result? The aquifers became polluted.

Then Israel started selling them water at a subsidized cost (cheaper than it cost us to pump it and cheaper than Israeli citizens pay for it), and continued doing so even when the Gazan government failed to pay to years, with a debt almost at $1B.  
And don't get me wrong, it was from a goodness of heart from our government, nor as a part of working towards peace. Unfortunately, our government don't put it as a priority. No, they done it as they thought it will help deescalate the situation with Gaza, and help things stabilised.

Well, since 7/10, things have escalated. So, why keep doing so?

And again, don't get me wrong, I don't want Gazan to suffer, but it's not Israel's responsibly to supply them with water. It was a transaction, that ended up fruitless. So why keep doing so?

And at a certain point They opened up the water pipe to the south, and yesterday or today (not sure) they built a second pipe, to increase the flow, as the goal is not to kill people, so we are doing it to save lives that we are not responsible for, but at the same time started finding other solutions, so we won't do it anymore, and other countries will. Because we have no more reason, no goal, in continuing doing so."
k708xzx,"This article is very thinly sourced and even explicitly says they can't verify the allegations. All the similar articles I've seen have relied on one PIJ terrorist guy bragging about how they're so clever they could even use water pipes to make rockets, and a single video of somebody digging up one pipe.

If someone has a source that actually provides solid verification of this on a wide scale I'd be interested to see it, but so far it seems like something that has possibly happened a couple of times (still reprehensible obviously) and has been blown into a generalised talking point to justify punitive action or collective punishment."

While, this video was an opposing player cutting Johnson's throat all while looking a bit more intentional than the Zednik injury, it looks more like the guy was going to cut back to deliver a big open-ice hit on Johnson.  At the speed he was going, that bump by Johnson's teammate was just enough to make the dude in the red jersey off-balance.

Some examples:

They denied killing the journalist Shereen Abu Akleh, then when investigations showed that they did it, they were like ‚Äúyeah okay we did it‚Äù.

In 1968's Al Karameh battle against Jordan, the official Israeli number for casualties is ‚Äú28-33 dead and 69-161 wounded‚Äù also in their official numbers ‚Äú27 tanks destroyed and 4 left behind, 2-4 APCs destroyed, 2 vehicles and 1 aircraft‚Äù and denied that any of their soldiers were captured. And there is no detailed report nor documents about the battle, and they even claim to have won that battle.

When in reality, Jordan has public documents and reports that go in boring details as well as voice and radio recordings of the whole battle, they have the list of 250 dead Israeli soldiers, their names and their positions in their museums, also countless images of the casualties and 30+ soldiers captured by Jordan, and so many other details that show Israel‚Äôs lying at its best, I can go into detail if you'd like.

Israel also withdrew randomly against their orders, and they haven‚Äôt achieved a single goal of their offense but lost their reputation.

They haven't been perfect by any means but they have done more than most armies would have considering what happened on the 7th. 

The reality is that Palestine started the first war and they lost territory, they launched another and lost territory and they have rejected peace at every turn. They have equally launched thousands of missiles and if not for the Iron Dome thousands of Israelis would be dead right now too. 

The sooner Hamas is destroyed, the sooner the area can have peace, the sooner those poor people can actually have a government who wants them to be more than a human shield or a martyr.

k706u78,"&gt; Its weakness and inability to defend Palestinian lives has been highlighted by the bloodshed since 7 October. Shtayyeh insisted, however, that it would never abandon non-violence to regain popularity.

&gt; ‚Äú[Abbas] can be popular in one minute,‚Äù the prime minister said. ‚ÄúHe can say: ‚ÄòOK, I order the Palestinian security forces to shoot at the Israelis.‚Äô But he is a realistic man.‚Äù

&gt; However, Shtayyeh acknowledged that anger was mounting rapidly among Palestinians, and that the situation on the West Bank was ‚Äúboiling‚Äù and becoming ‚Äúseriously dangerous‚Äù, leaving the PA stuck between a furious population and a violent and callous Israeli government.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe are caught between the rock and the hammer,‚Äù he said.

A huge part of the reason why the PA is unpopular among Palestinians is because it cannot and will not protect them against Israeli violence and ever growing settlements taking Palestinian land.

This is also why Hamas can be considered more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù - they promise to protect Palestinians from Israeli aggression. Now the way they do this is by unjustifiable terrorism means, but it explains why Palestinians may be more inclined to be sympathetic to a government that at least claims to protect them.

If Israel wants peace, they need to immediately start normalizing relations with the PA. They need to pledge to start dismantling illegal settlements. They need to show that the PA is a viable option for the Palestinian people that will bring peace and security."
k706tgi,What are they shooting? Just buildings or is there like a bunch of little hamas‚Äôs hiding in the buildings waiting for Santa?
k706t9v,"It absolutely isn‚Äôt above doing questionable stuff, but it is above this.

I cannot stress enough how absolutely insane this would be. No real benefit and a fallout that would result in such chaos and cost America any and all international standing. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm sure Israel would love to use nerve gas on Hamas tunnels. It‚Äôs the ideal weapon for attacking enclosed spaces without having to fight. The most recent recorded use was Japan during the second sino Japanese war and it was tremendously effective.

But they will never, ever do it. Every country (including the US) would immediately cease any military or political support. Chemical weapons are that big a deal."

k706snh,"First.  The Torah has nothing to do with this.

Yes, war is two disagreeing countries.

In 48 it was 7 disagreeing countries attracking 1.  Not a genocide by Israel. Egypt, transjordan, iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Saudi Arabia all attacked Israel.  An attempted genocide on the Arab side yes. 

In 67, is was a slightly different 7 against 1. The UAE and Kuwait joined in. Egypt and Yemen didn't participate.  Again an attempted genocide of Israel, but not by Israel.

But genocide is when someone it's trying to irradicate all people's of another side.  

Israel has never directly and intentionally targeted civilians. 

That is the difference. 

Gazans have 100% tried to commit genocide against Israel. It's in their charter to obliterate Israel and all jews. 

That is genocide."

I did the math once with extremely rough numbers. The tunnels span almost 700-760km. Not hard to figure out the volume. To fill that amount of space with gas is completely out of the question. Even flooding it with water would require an unrealistic amount of water. Let alone that Hamas is bot stupid, they have ways of dealing with the tunnels. One day, someone will write a book about the absolute miracle of a feat that these tunnels have come to become with so little resources.

As far us providing weapons, rest assured, the us does provide all kinds of weapons. What you mention here are the least of it.

Again, expressly to bolster the argument that Israel is Taking unjust action or response. I‚Äôve not encountered the sentiment being used any other way.

legitimate reporting on the conflict (mainstream or credible news sources, professional reporting, etc) sometimes uses this term but only (as I‚Äôve seen anyway) in the context of responding to criticism, quoting or interviewing people who take a critical stance in Israeli activity."

UK, France and US gave tremendous amounts of money and weapons to Israel since its creation. France UK and israel literally went to war together against egypt. 

US gave unlimited amount of money and weapons since day 1 and still do so due to zinoist Christians and the need to maintain ""an American base"" in mid East.

So it's not really a balanced game ...to colonise a land with the literal unlimited upport of the world super powers. 

Speaking of violence ... the number of deaths on palestinan side was way way way way more than israelis. (In case you didn't notice). 

Am mot trying to reverse history, I am trying to work for a better future for both israelis and paleatinans. I believe in two state solution. But the story of history must be correctly understood. 

Yes both sides did mistakes. There is no ""good"" vs ""evil"" but we need to understand that Palestinians were colonised. Admiting this historical fact will help a lot.

 Gaza is actually occupied according to international law:

Seriously though, countries like Iraq and Yemen and Syria have a lot of Arab-vs-Arab fighting. If the Zionists were NOT Jewish, but were instead Turks or British people, the Arabs of Palestine would be fighting them instead (and they DID!)

IDK if Israel has been intentionally targeting journalists or not, but the ICTR's descriptions of that ""incitement"" seem applicable to *a lot* of Arabic media. Targeting outlets engaged in it in areas/countries with which Israel is at war could be justifiable. Gaza certainly, Syria, perhaps Lebanon (the maritime boundary agreement might preclused it), not sure about WB (tho their media frequently crosses the line).

War crimes trials of Palestinian journalists in future could also occur: 3 Rwandan media figures were sentenced to up to 35 year for their role in inciting the Rwandan genocide, which the Simchat Torah pogrom resembled in some ways."

egypt and israel both blockaded gaza after hamas came to power to contain the violence

"" zionists are not letting us pray in masjidul aksa "" this is 100% NOT true at all

of course, there is a small group of hooligans, who start rioting, but it is more or less contained

What I want is a state in which Israelis and Palestinians have equal representation. In the state of Israel that is impossible. From its very constitution and its institutions it is set up to exclude. A new state will have to built from the ground up. The eradication of Israel means the eradication of governmental structures, not the eradication of Israelis.

As much as I don‚Äôt like Hamas: saying they don‚Äôt care about Palestinians is a little silly, after all they were democratically elected by the citizens of Gaza. I just think it‚Äôs counterproductive to focus on their crimes because it turns the focus away from the primary crime that‚Äôs happening.

The claims about Hamas hiding among civilians is also overblown. There have been many cases in which the Israeli military has bombed media companies, hospitals and so on and just claimed Hamas was in there without any proof whatsoever.

Wishing terror attacks on the West, when our leaders (against most of our wishes) loudly and proudly support Netanyahu. 

Go and view the footage of the dead Palestinian babies that lie still across Gaza. It‚Äôs widely available and it‚Äôs traumatising to scroll across that by accident. So many tiny, lifeless bodies. A large number of them are missing heads or limbs, others whose limbs are the only pieces found. The footage of all the screaming, crying orphans, covered in dust and the blood of their families. The footage of civilian apartment buildings, completely flattened with residents still inside. 

Go and watch the interview with the Norwegian doctor who categorically states that there has never been any shred of evidence of Hamas presence or control in those hospitals, in the decades that he and his colleagues have worked there - strictly operating under the Geneva convention. The hospitals Israel are threatening to bomb, despite knowing that this alone will kill 14,000+ civilians - and many more, through removal of their access to medical treatment. Repeated ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù do not grant medical staff the ability to evacuate sick and dying patients, when there is nowhere safe to go and there are no resources available. 

Israel are committing war crimes against an entire population in retaliation for a terrorist attack carried out by a minority. They do this knowing there are Israeli hostages in those tunnels and in Palestinian homes. Netanyahu‚Äôs vengeance trumps human life, whether that life is Palestinian or Israeli.

I don't think you actually live in Israel so i don't expect you to know this but you should. The solution isn't carpet bombing Gaza, that is just gonna make Arab countries more and more frustrated and it's gonna give them a reason to attack Isral and by doing that murdering Israeli civilians. This isn't even gonna make the hostages return home safely since they're eventually gonna get killed if they haven't already been. If these attacks led to the death of Hamas members it would've already been on the news since it would give a reason for the free Palestine movement to stop, something Israel has been  unsuccessful in. A two state solution needs to be put into action, but it needs to have Palestinians best interests in mind, just as much as Israeli civilians.

The Muslims who did this feared that with Saudia Arabia joining ties with Israel it would be a strong coalition against Iran and  the possibility of an Islamic state.  3.  About half the outing population supported Hamas,  however when you consider 50% of their population are under voting age that's really only 25%  of the total population supporting them.  With it being such a young population it really leaves the possibility of indoctrination of their your to hamas,  which is why the boots on the ground approach should have happened earlier as it would have less civilian casualties than shelling.   Everything you kill someone's kids or their parents you are likely to create a future enemy willing to give his life because the bombing essentially destroyed it.  We saw this with the creation of ISIS after we fought the taliban.
There are also action along the west Bank that have been counter to what the world initially recognized as Israel's borders...
Palestine has been offered a 2 state solution multiple times but would rather fight jews because they don't recognize them on their land,  though I would greatly question what makes it their (arab)lands.

Wipe out hamas,  internationally manage contested areas with a UN police force not the idf.  Israel should recognize palestine boarders  as of the 67 agreement regardless of what the Arab world feels about Israel.

Answer the last question please, how do you justify what happened?"
k703mhc,"Let me try to clarify this because prior to October 7th I also bought into a lot of the BS pro Palestinians lines. If you really are interested let me explain what I've learned so far. 

1.  Genocide is the deliberate killing or severe mistreatment of a large number of people from a particular national or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group. Israel has not done this. There are 2 million Palestinians (who are full citizens)  living in israel. They have the highest standard of living out of any palestinian group in the Arab world.  They represent 20% of the government,  sit on the supreme court and have high ranking military positions.  Every day tens of thousands more come from Palestine to work. The entire Palestinian population Israel, Gaza, and Palestine has increased about 5x.  

This is not a genocide. If we are talking about occupied west bank, that population too is increasing. Palestinians there are discriminated against, they have hardships because of military checkpoints and there is violence with conflicts with the IDF.  It is not the systematic killing of innocent people.  If Palestinians in the west bank had accepted and followed Oslo and not launched the second intifada, they would be celebrating their 30th day of independence last year.  

2. Occupation.  After Oslo which the palestinians agreed to, the west bank was split into three regions. A B and C.  C would remain occupied militarily while there was a deescalation of tensions, and terrorist groups (hezbola) would be routed out.  Arafat did not do this and the Israelis created illegal settlements on the borderlands of area C.  The deal fell apart and Israel is still occupying.  But there were offers to leave many times. Israel does not want to be there. 

Gaza is not an occupied territory.  I don't know who is arguing at Harvard that it is, but there is not a single Jew living there except for the hostages.  Gaza was given to the Palestinians in a land for peace deal in 2005.  They had total control to do what they want.  In 2007 they voted in Hamas and Israel built a border - like all other countries.  Even still, trade continued.  Up until Oct 7, thousands of Gazans crossed into Israel ever say for work.  If you argue that Israel controls the skies, I'd argue that south Korea does this too and is not occupying north Korea.

3. Apartheid.  This one is really awful when I saw what was happening.  The UN created a special rapporteur made up of 24 antisemitic countries with human rights violations. Syria, north Korea, Russia, lebanon, Afghanistan, etc.   They also changed the definition of apartheid to be something completely different than south African apartheid.  All these countries signed off on their report. No one else in the UN did.  Keep in mind the UN has a pretty horrific record of these types of things. Amnesty international followed suit claiming apartheid in area C.

So you have an international report from dubious countries that all claim their atrocities are fine, stating that apartheid (but not south Africa apartheid) is taking place. And the only country in the world this is happening in is Israel - a democracy no less.  Not Syria, or North Korea, or Afghanistan or Iraq - but Israel.  Amnesty international is the same deal.  Not a single other country has come under their new special definition of apartheid.  So yes I call BS on that too.  As did the US recently when they overwhelmingly passed a motion rejecting the UN and these NGOs claims. You can argue that thats part of a JeWiSh CoNsPiRaCy but then I think you've lost the plot.  

Hope this helps and please reach out if I got anything wrong of you have questions.  I sincerely felt like you one month ago and now realize how I was tricked."
k703m5i,"In a zionist propaganda nutshell.

Not my post but [**Kate090996**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kate090996/)**'s:** 

&amp;#x200B;

 

TLDR; most of those times that people call peace negotiation there wasn't a Palestinian delegation, when it was Israel requested ridiculous things like access over water supply, complete demilitarization , airspace control, movement control, right to have an army on the ground, control over agricultural land in Gaza, a ridiculous amount of land and historical significant cities of Palestinians , \* always wanting to expand settlement\* , cashing in on TVA. Almost none of the times important issues like borders of a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements were discussed. No sane delegation of a country would accept another country to have that much control over their own.

&gt;1949 Armistice

The Palestinians did not have direct representation in these negotiations. It was an armistice to halt the fighting not a peace settlement.

&gt;1967 Allon Plan

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

included significant territorial expansion into the West Bank and Gaza Strip,it was made to enable an Israeli annexation of¬†East Jerusalem, the¬†Etzion Bloc, and most of the¬†Jordan Valley.¬†All remaining parts of the West Bank, containing the majority of Palestinians, were to be returned to Jordan

&gt;Roger's plan

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

Rogers Plan called for a ceasefire and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied during the Six-Day War in 1967. It proposed that Israel would return to the pre-war borders with minor modifications in exchange for peace agreements with its Arab neighbors. Again, *there were no palestinian representatives* did not directly address the Palestinian issue, it addressed Israel relations with Arab neighbors. It didn't work out because Israel wasn't too keen on returning to its pre-1967 borders, and some Arab states wanted a solution that includes a state for Palestinians.

&gt;Geneva 73

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

The conference's focus was on broader Arab-Israeli relations, it involved Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and the United States as the mediator.

&gt;1978 Camp David Accords

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

It was between Egypt and Israel, nothing to do with Palestine. The accords did not address core Palestinian concerns

PLO was not part of the negotiations

Even The¬†UN General Assembly¬†rejected the¬†Framework

&gt;1979 Egypt treaty

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

The upper accords lead to this treaty so it's basically the same thing

&gt;Madrid

The Palestinians did not have direct\* representation

the first time that Israelis and Palestinians engaged in direct, face-to-face talks *except* it was by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team. The focus was primarily on negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with the understanding that the Palestinian issue would be addressed *later* in the process

&gt;Oslo accords

Which are super important as this time it was really PLO standing there . There is a lot to read about it

PLO recognized Istrael as a state that has the right to exist but Israel recognized PLO only as the representative of the Palestinian people, not as a legitimate government

Under the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into three zones: Area A, Area B, and Area C, each with different levels of Palestinian self-rule and Israeli military presence:

Area A: Under full Palestinian civil and security control. Area B: Under Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control. Area C: Under full Israeli civil and security control.

But there was a problem, Israel was supposed to withdraw its army and while it did withdraw it from some places, it did it very slowly and in some other places not at all, all the while continuing the agressive expansion of illegal settlements. In 2002 Israeli army re-occupied what it gave to palestinian control anyway.

Moreover the Olso accords did not address core status issues, such as the borders of a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements etc

&gt;1994 Jordan peace treaty

Yeah...this was exactly that, between Jordan and Israel and had stuff like drugs, border crossing, environmental issues etc. Nothing to do with Palestine

&gt;Oslo II Accord (1995)

Israel was opposed to an extended international presence in the territories, which Palestinians wanted as a buffer and for it to monitor Israeli activities.

&gt;2000 Camp David Summit

While Palestinians accepted to keep only 22% of the original historic Palestine, Israel wanted more.

Palestinian negotiators accepted the Green Line borders (1949 armistice lines) for the West Bank but the Israelis rejected this proposal

Israel was not willing to cede sovereignty over East Jerusalem, including the Old City, to the Palestinians. The Palestinians sought East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state and it was a historical holy place.

Israel wanted that historically important Arab neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and at-Tur would remain under Israeli sovereignty

Israel suggested annexing approximately 9% of the West Bank, particularly areas with large settlement blocks, and in return offered land from the Negev desert, which is less valuable.

Israel was opposed to the Right of Return of Palestinians and said that any right of return would pose a threat to Israel's *Jewish character*

*Israel wanted also to be allowed to use its airspace of Palestine the right to deploy troops on Palestinian territory*

*Israel also demanded that the Palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of police,*

*Israel sought control over the main water aquifers located in the West Bank.* They wanted control over water

Israel would collect Value Added Tax (VAT) and import duties on goods destined for the Palestinian territories, which they do and are supposed to transfer the funds to PLO but there have been instances when they didn't. Any divergence from Israeli trade policy, particularly tariffs, required Israeli approval.

&gt;Road Map for Peace (2002-2003):

Israel's acceptance of a *provisional* Palestinian state was conditional on Palestine's complete disarmament and giving up any right to an army or armed forces. Again.

Israel formally accepted the Road Map but later attached 14 reservations in which they said for example they wouldn't accept stipulations that would limit *""natural growth""* within existing settlements. So basically they will continue with the settlements, which they call "" natural growth"" also said that it should not include any hint of a right of return for Palestinian refugees to Israel.

Israel also wanted to retain control over Palestinian airspace and electromagnetic (broadcasting) fields, asked to be no mention of the 1967 borders or any other borders which PLO wanted as a starting point, asked for military control in Jordan Valley."

Credit to [**Kate090996**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kate090996/)  for this post.

TLDR; most of those times that people call peace negotiation there wasn't a Palestinian delegation, when it was Israel requested ridiculous things like access over water supply, complete demilitarization , airspace control, movement control, right to have an army on the ground, control over agricultural land in Gaza, a ridiculous amount of land and historical significant cities of Palestinians , \* always wanting to expand settlement\* , cashing in on TVA. Almost none of the times important issues like borders of a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements were discussed. No sane delegation of a country would accept another country to have that much control over their own.

&gt;1949 Armistice

The Palestinians did not have direct representation in these negotiations. It was an armistice to halt the fighting not a peace settlement.

&gt;1967 Allon Plan

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

included significant territorial expansion into the West Bank and Gaza Strip,it was made to enable an Israeli annexation of¬†East Jerusalem, the¬†Etzion Bloc, and most of the¬†Jordan Valley.¬†All remaining parts of the West Bank, containing the majority of Palestinians, were to be returned to Jordan

&gt;Roger's plan

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

Rogers Plan called for a ceasefire and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied during the Six-Day War in 1967. It proposed that Israel would return to the pre-war borders with minor modifications in exchange for peace agreements with its Arab neighbors. Again, *there were no palestinian representatives* did not directly address the Palestinian issue, it addressed Israel relations with Arab neighbors. It didn't work out because Israel wasn't too keen on returning to its pre-1967 borders, and some Arab states wanted a solution that includes a state for Palestinians.

&gt;Geneva 73

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

The conference's focus was on broader Arab-Israeli relations, it involved Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and the United States as the mediator.

&gt;1978 Camp David Accords

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

It was between Egypt and Israel, nothing to do with Palestine. The accords did not address core Palestinian concerns

PLO was not part of the negotiations

Even The¬†UN General Assembly¬†rejected the¬†Framework

&gt;1979 Egypt treaty

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

The upper accords lead to this treaty so it's basically the same thing

&gt;Madrid

The Palestinians did not have direct\* representation

the first time that Israelis and Palestinians engaged in direct, face-to-face talks *except* it was by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team. The focus was primarily on negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with the understanding that the Palestinian issue would be addressed *later* in the process

&gt;Oslo accords

Which are super important as this time it was really PLO standing there . There is a lot to read about it

PLO recognized Istrael as a state that has the right to exist but Israel recognized PLO only as the representative of the Palestinian people, not as a legitimate government

Under the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into three zones: Area A, Area B, and Area C, each with different levels of Palestinian self-rule and Israeli military presence:

Area A: Under full Palestinian civil and security control. Area B: Under Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control. Area C: Under full Israeli civil and security control.

But there was a problem, Israel was supposed to withdraw its army and while it did withdraw it from some places, it did it very slowly and in some other places not at all, all the while continuing the agressive expansion of illegal settlements. In 2002 Israeli army re-occupied what it gave to palestinian control anyway.

Moreover the Olso accords did not address core status issues, such as the borders of a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements etc

&gt;1994 Jordan peace treaty

Yeah...this was exactly that, between Jordan and Israel and had stuff like drugs, border crossing, environmental issues etc. Nothing to do with Palestine

&gt;Oslo II Accord (1995)

Israel was opposed to an extended international presence in the territories, which Palestinians wanted as a buffer and for it to monitor Israeli activities.

&gt;2000 Camp David Summit

While Palestinians accepted to keep only 22% of the original historic Palestine, Israel wanted more.

Palestinian negotiators accepted the Green Line borders (1949 armistice lines) for the West Bank but the Israelis rejected this proposal

Israel was not willing to cede sovereignty over East Jerusalem, including the Old City, to the Palestinians. The Palestinians sought East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state and it was a historical holy place.

k703g4z,"Ukraine is an internationally agreed upon country with defined borders, that Russia even agreed to when Ukraine declared independence. There was no ""Palestine"" in 1948. There were levantian Arabs living there, some identified as Syrian, and a Palestinian National movement only took root to counter the Zionist movement. 

So no, pre-1948, Arabs living in Palestine did not identify as significantly different than those from Syria or Jordan. These lines were drawn in the sand post WW1, and didn't reflect any nationalist identities of the people living there. 

Contrast to the Zionists who had clear aims of living inside what is now defined as Israel with a strong nationalist identity."

Did the Jews in the ghettos get international aid in the millions?
Just trying to paint the full picture.
Also, Palestinians have been able to go into Israel to work for a long while now, did Jews get the privilege of that with pay?
I get that what is happening in Gaza is undeniably horrific violence that must stop and I agree, but to compare the Gazan plight to the Jews in the Holocaust is just poor.

By this same logic Greece, Syria Bulgaria etc. also have no claim to the land being theres

Palestinians formally started the war perhaps, but again it was in response to a loss of land. The land that made up the current state of Israel far exceeded that which was owned by Jewish individuals at the time. Jewish people at the time did not peacefully accept the decision, there was anti Palestinian violence on there behalf which can't be put down to responding to Palestinian aggression. And in any case, the Jewish people were just new migrants, the idea that they ought to have a state because some of them moved there (and I should point out the numbers were far lower than the Palestinians) is a jump and can't be compared to any other country's founding. 

Yes, if land and property was stolen it ought to be paid back. It was quite literally stolen after. Even if we take the idea at face value that Palestine started the war, it is a massive jump to say then that any Palestinian deserved to have their property and land stolen as they were violently made to leave it.

and in their 20 years of fighting israel never targeted anyone who isn't Israeli, for example no attacks on synagogue outside Israel like ISIS used to do.

Here's by their own words in their new charter announced in 2017:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the **Zionist project not with the Jews** because of their religion. Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine. Yet, it is the Zionists who constantly identify Judaism and the Jews with their own colonial project and illegal entity.

k702qzb,"Israel has a much higher cost of living than does Russia.

White phosphorus is banned as a weapon. It's still used as a signaling gas on the battlefield and for hiding troop positions by covering up movements. Those are uses legal under international law and those are the only times it gets used."
k702ocz,Yeah. In theory I'm in favor of open borders and freedom of movement like u said. I just dont think it's realistic in practice.

Remember, the Zionists that reject Jesus never knew God, they worship what boils down to satan. 

They are murdering thousands of children with tons of bombs, without empathy or mercy for 20+ days straight.

They think they are untouchable again especially with US backing them up.

k702ifw,"The fact that the 'election' took place almost 20 years ago, further supports my point that Hamas does not represent Palestinians. This is reinforced by the verifiable fact that the average age of Palestinians living in Gaza is 18 -- meaning the majority were not old enough to vote, probably not old enough to even *remember* the so-called election. 

You can carry-on and on about your criticisms of Hamas. That's fine. They're legitimate criticisms. However, this legitimacy ends when you project them onto all Palestinians. 

To say again: 

**Hamas does not represent palestinians. collective punishment/retaliation on a civilian population, for real or perceived grievances against a specific organisation, is a war crime -- by definition.** 

There is no discussion. This has been clearly outlined by the UN, Geneva and Hague Conventions. If you endorse the collective blame, punishment and retaliation on ordinary Palestinians because of the crimes of Hamas, you are endorsing literal war crimes."
k702ib6,"Thanks for the response.

First of all. I have to say that I'm pro-Israel. This is a selfish opinion from the perspective of a goy living in a goyim nation where a lot of diaspora Jews reside.

I've expressed by perspective in detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17hsb6b/a\_goyim\_perspective\_ideally\_we\_should\_defend\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17hsb6b/a_goyim_perspective_ideally_we_should_defend_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Basically, my observation is that a lot of diaspora Jews are very uncivilized. I'm defining civilized as somebody who can harmoniously assimilate into a nation and care about all the people within the nation, especially the various workers in the nation whose labor is utilized for daily life.

I don't think it's the diaspora Jew's fault that he is uncivilized. It is not a feature that is an intrinsic characteristic, but it is a feature that is forced upon the Jew because of his history. The diaspora Jew is very anxious of non-Jews in their host nation. He had to be this way for self preservation as an identity throughout time.

The anti-Semite is upset that the diaspora Jew cannot assimilate and become like a brother in a national brotherhood. This anti-Semitism further cloisters the Jew in his isolated Jewish identity. It reinforces that Jewish identity. This cloistering also has a reciprocal effect on the anti-Semite. They both become skeptical of one another, and this skepticism grows.

I think it's a terrible plight, what the Jews had to endure. However, a hopeful future is one in which the diaspora Jew calms his nerves and assimilates like other civilized people. Meanwhile, a Jewish identity is carried forward though the national identity of Israel. This is an outcome that the goyim want, and I think this is an outcome that the diaspora Jew can also come to want once he understands the benefits of letting one's guard down and having a common brotherhood with the fellow citizen.

You may disagree with that analysis. But, based on my observation, if a nation is in a state of peace for a long time, it has a civilizing influence on the citizenry and there is an element of cohesion and peace than can occur.

And, as stable nations remain in peace with one another and trade with one another, not just goods, but also ideas and stories, and as the citizens themselves travel and taste different nations, there may be encountered gradual global sensibilities.

On the subject of the theft of land.

1&gt; First of all, it ought to be recognized that private property of any individual or collective identity is largely maintained through narrative. Land in the beginning belongs to nobody. It is a feature of nature.

2&gt; Secondly, a newborn is born without any conception of what is its property and what is not its property. It is given the conception of the property nature of things via its own action in the world and also via narrative transfer from the prior generations.

3&gt; Third of all, different individual and collective identities may hold in their imagination and memory different narratives and different conceptions of what is or is not its private property, or what is owed to it or not owed to it.

The conflict over belongingness is not necessarily a feature can can be inspected objectively. A historical analysis will never yield the truth of the matter because the truth resides in the subjective memories of competing identities who have their own conception or narrative about the truth.

That's my pov. And I think it's an accurate pov that people fail to grapple with."

And if you go far you can make claim to any land in the world because different groups have been migrating since the dawn of time and jews of european blood actually have no genetic claim to that land.

The arabs are doing nothing because westen powers have consistently invaded ,colonised and destablized us and most of the none westen world. especially the Us which has toppled democratic governments because it went against their interests.

They started wars in vietnam, afghanist and Iraq and committed untold atrocities,using media to dehumanize them and lies like ""wmd"" to justify it when the real goal was always to conquer and further their interest.

Do you not realize that most arab countries are still recovering either from a history of being colonized and/or dealing with a corrupt government put by the us ? much less the threat of war that the Us constantly uses?"

k702brf,"You claim you're not into revising history but that's exactly what you're doing here. The Zionist project is not colonialism. The Zionist project was active in Israel before the Brits arrived here, it has a different culture than British culture (and you can see it based on language and history etc...) And since the 30s the Brits did a lot to sabotage this project, and they did because they gave in to Palestinian violence by the way. 

Speaking of Palestinian violence, this is very well documented, you can enter Wikipedia and see the aggressive side on this conflict were the Arabs. They weren't willing to accept any compromise whatsoever, and decided this entire piece of land belongs to them (which wasn't true legally and morally), but their solution was to kill all the Jews.

They attacked Israel in 47 in response to the UN deciding to divide the land into two countries. Not negotiation, not peace, just violence. Israel did what it had to to defend itself. And Israel was better than the Arabs in fighting and other things. It doesn't make the Arabs automatically more moral."
k702bng,Exactly my opinion
k702bm4,"Yes. and they have been enforcing illegal occupation and aparthied for the last 60 years on palastenians in the WB and Gaza. 

History didn't start on oct 7th. these attacks didn't happen in vaccum. When you occupy people they have the right to self defence and deter their enemy.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't agree on Hamas tactics or targeting any civlians, I think who did this should be put on trial. But, their cause is just. and Israel is an aggressor even before hamas was created.

&amp;#x200B;

And for all we know, the response to killing civilians shouldn't be to put 2 mil people without water for over 15 days now. **WATER. That's a war crime.** If china or russia or anyone else did such a thing as a response to an attack we wouldn't have a problem saying that..

The hashtags ‚Äú#PrayForGaza‚Äù, ‚Äú#GazaUnderAttack‚Äù were restricted or marked as sensitive posts on Twitter but when Israeli officials post videos of them bombarding Gaza with false titles and descriptions, that‚Äôs not restricted. And so on.

These are just simple examples of why Arabic media is more unbiased than Western outlets. Of course they have their biases, like Al Jazeera never reporting about Hamas' crimes against civilians until they are debunked (like the 40 babies lie, they never reported it until it was proven a lie).

Again, I'm not saying Arabic media is not biased, they are just more unbiased than other medias. And in the topics I sent, these are facts and not just them reporting one point of view, they reported what the Israelis said, or posted videos of the events and not just words like most Western media reports: ‚ÄúI think I've just seen beheaded babies‚Äù.

I consider myself pretty acquainted with the situation from the 30s until today, and I have taken both sides before, and followed both medias and can spot when a media outlet is being biased and blind or unbiased and transparent (in this topic I mean, I'm not a detective in everything).

But still, I‚Äôm not sure what part of the sources I sent seem suspicious? They reported literally what the Israeli officials said, and they shared videos published by Hezbollah themselves, there are bo touches added.

Also, there are also many Western media that reported these same events like the CNN report that I included. But I would rather send the main sources rather than English ones that were copied from those."

&gt;There are such thing as Palestinian Jews

Palestine was never a country. A Palestinian Jew will just mean a Jew that was born within the region of Palestine. Like myself.

&gt;who have been openly vocal against Zionism for decades.

95% of the Jews in the world are Zionists. There's a small minority such as the Neturi Karta who are antizionists, who work with Iran against Jews, who deny the Holocaust, etc... and they've been banned by every other Jewish group, including the Satmar Jews, who are also ""Anti-Zionist"". But not nearly as extreme as them.

&gt;Because they don‚Äôt have to worry about Muslim anti semitism. They are semites too and recognize Jews as people of the book who have protected rights in Islam since many prophets in the quran are Israelites.

Right. They were treated perfectly fine by Muslims, like being second class citizen, subject to different laws, subject to humiliating laws, often subject to pogroms and hatred. Being cannon fodder in wars even. 

You're right that we were treated significantly better in the Muslim world then in Europe. But the idea that we were completely safe there is ridiculous.

Also, antisemitism is hatred against Jews, not all semites. Jew-hatred was just a bit too on the nose. Arabs can very much be Antisemitic. 

&gt;Why should they divide their land in half for colonizers

Wasn't their land, they owned parts of it, but so did the Jews.

&gt;Why should people have to move and make way for them?

They didn't. It was the Arabs' declaration of war and refusal for peace that caused the Nakba.

&gt;Is it the Palestinians fault your not safe in anti Semitic Europe

No it is not. I mean, now it is as seen in the media, many of the Pro-Palestinians attack random Jews because of Israel.

&gt;Why take their land because of mistreatment elsewhere???

Again, not their land."

[Protest against the UK enabling the war on Yemen in London](https://www.counterfire.org/article/protesters-march-against-the-uk-enabling-the-war-on-yemen/)

&gt;When Palestinians were consistently, institutionally and legally discriminated against in Lebanon (1948 to today), no one marched in the streets of London.

Plenty of the Palestinians in question joined in on a literal civil war partially as a result of things like this so if you have a point about Palestinians or people in general only caring about Palestinians when it involves Jews I'd suggest you scrap it considering the history of Palestinians having no problem revolting against the wishes of Arab governments that treated them questionably.   


Palestinians didn't exclusively fight against Israel although Palestinians were still more concerned with protesting the root cause of their suffering (Israel) as opposed to the country they've been made refugees to mistreating them who they considered their brethren ([case in point](https://www.reportdigital.co.uk/reportage-photo-protest-against-the-israeli-invasion-of-lebanon-london-1982-06-aug-image00119368.html)) no matter what. Palestinians have historically had far larger problems to protest against but I'm sure theres been some protests regarding this issue in Lebanon. I know my dad went out to pro-Palestinian protests in NYC when the Lebanese civil war was ongoing although I'm not sure if it was specifically related to the civil war or even Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. If your point is about people not caring about Palestinians in Lebanon then thats baloney because people and organizations do [https://nakba.amnesty.org/en/chapters/lebanon/](https://nakba.amnesty.org/en/chapters/lebanon/).

&gt;When (in September 1970) Jordan fought with the PLO and killed 3,400 Palestinians, no one marched in the streets of London.

Jordan mainly killed militants, and here Palestinians were actually engaged in warfare as opposed to protesting although that also happened in Jordan, after it was over the PLO and Jordan reconciled. As a matter of fact three of the four prime ministers of Jordan that were in office during the war were of Palestinian origin. Palestinians were far more likely to protest against the country that had been systemically displacing, oppressing and killing them for decades (Israel) as opposed to protesting a government in large part made up of people of Palestinian origin which they had squabbles with. Same situation with the Hamas-Fatah conflict, what was there to protest about? They were essentially the same people involved in infighting. Whatever senseless killing there was in Jordan, Lebanon and the Gaza strip (between Hamas and Fatah) is unfortunate but irrelevant in the big picture when the main issue was Israel.   


Also Gazans did protest against Hamas [https://www.timesofisrael.com/protests-against-hamas-reemerge-in-the-streets-of-gaza-but-will-they-persist/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/protests-against-hamas-reemerge-in-the-streets-of-gaza-but-will-they-persist/).

&gt;When in the Lebanese Civil Wars (first started in 1975) over 150,000 were killed, including many Palestinians, no one marched in the streets of London.

The focus on Israel was because generally speaking Palestinians didn't really harbor any hatred for Lebanese people, whatever issues Palestinians had that were exacerbated by the Lebanese government were nowhere as severe and systemic as that of Israel's policies towards Palestinians in their own homeland. Yes there was fighting against certain Lebanese militias and whatnot in Lebanon, no Palestinians don't only start to rebel or protest against policies negatively affecting them when it involved Jews, yes the bigger issue at hand was Israel and yes thats why protests in the west were mainly directed against it. 

&gt;When ISIS (2015) and later the Syrian government (2018) fought Palestinians in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, killed many people there and ethnically cleansed 18,000 Palestinians by removing them from the camp, no one marched in the streets of London.

This is just silly

People and countries did far more serious things than protesting in response to ISIS' actions.

&gt;When Hamas slaughtered in Gaza 100s of PLO supporters in the Fatah‚ÄìHamas conflict (2007), and set up a brutal Islamist regime that persecuted gays, silenced all opposition and unleashed awful violence against Israel (2001 to 2023), no one marched in the streets of London.

Pro-Israelis certainly protested.  


So far we've established you didn't bother researching your own claims at all and you've used false equivalencies between Arab infighting, not comparable to that of Israel's systemic actions, lies about people not caring in regards to say Afghanistan and Syria all making you fail to show Palestinians or pro-Palestinians as hypocrites.

What I'm more curious about is; are you actually concerned with some imagined lack of opposition to these conflicts or are you just trying to discredit pro-Palestinian protests? Are you of the opinion that these other conflicts - if they weren't spoken about, despite the fact that they were - should have also been spoken about alongside Palestine or do you not want any pro-Palestine protests at all and are mainly interested in reserving protests for other conflicts you thought were more deserving that don't involve Israel?"

Nonetheless, Party X does it, even if they could've deployed those military assets underneath industrial locations, open fields or any other places where the number of civilians is minimal.

In case Party Y targets one of those legitimate military targets, the responsibility for the death of the civilians who are killed as collateral damage lies on Party X.

In other words, Hamas is responsible for the civilian deaths in Gaza."

This isn't to say one is worse or better but that comparison are difficult.

And finally, those Jewish people currently live lives as citizens in a country. The Palestinians live under an occupation where they live under military rule (unlike settlers living in the same areas - hence why apartheid is a fair term) with considerably worse conditions for living (i.e. lack of water, threats of violence), no real passports etc. Again, not comparable situations"

It started with immigration. Then expanding that immigration and "" protecting it"" ..then creating a country by force..then defending thst country and ""winning"" new terroritory. 

But in the eyes of history , this is classic colonial settlement logic.

Am not into reversing history. What happened happend... I believe in the liberation of palestine...but this liberation is about giving paleatinans equal rights and a country they can live in dignified instead of being stateless refugees. It doesn't have to happen by ethniclly cleansing israelis who now live there.

Zinosim achieved it's goal and Jews now have a country. Paleatinans who are indenginous to the land and lived there continously are still stateless.

"" Do you think you will be admitted into Paradise without being tested like those before you?

When he and the ÀπremainingÀ∫ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, ‚ÄúNow we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.‚Äù But those ÀπbelieversÀ∫ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, ‚ÄúHow many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah!

"" When they advanced to face Goliath and his warriors, they prayed, ‚ÄúOur Lord! Shower us with perseverance, make our steps firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.‚Äù "" (Al-Baqarah verse 250)

It only meant that the territory was owned by Palestine, Palestinians also wanted independence from Hamas and the whole deal was filled with zionist agenda made to make Palestinians suffer in the long run. ONE of the ways Israel could fight Hamas is by temporeraly evacuating Palestinians in Israel where they plan to bomb. Israel also has information that the general public doesn't, they know who the members of Hamas are and inspecting the area and targeting only Hamas members isn't hard at all. Hamas' attack was the response of 75 years of constant genocide and murder, this would've never happened if Israel didn't continuously attack civilians for 75 years in an attempt to widen their territory. It's not justified but there's a reason behind it, on the other hand there's no reason to carpet bomb gaza ""to not let events lile this happen again"" or ""to bring back the hostages"" since this happened cause of years and years of genicide and hostages cannot safely return home if they're killed by these bombings. Ceasefire needs to be put into action, cutting off water, fuel and food to Palestinians isn't gonna make Hamas free the hostages.

Similar shit happened in 2014 and it was named ‚ÄúOperation protective edge‚Äù After the Kidnapping &amp; Murder of 3 Israeli Teens allegedly by Hamas (Opinions divided among Israel's Security Services on who was actually behind it), Disproportionate Collective Punishment ensued against the people of Gaza (estimated 2104 Palestinians killed, including 1,462 civilians, of whom 495 were children and 253 women. 17,200 homes destroyed or severely damaged. More than 10,000 injured) 

The whole thing is a ‚ÄúWash-Rinse-Repeat‚Äù cycle in which Hamas the extremist terrorist group funded by Israel and Qatar attacks incompetently causing casualties in the occupied territories; Israel welcomes the attack and retaliates with triple to four times more damage to the Gaza civilians who are already living in a prison in the most dire conditions in one of the most densely populated area in the whole world.

Also why are you ignoring the war the Palestinians started at 48? They could have stayed in their homes and live peacefully alongside the Jews. You don‚Äôt get to start a war and then cry you‚Äôve been ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù. Many of them immigrated to other neighbor countries because they didn‚Äôt want to share the land.

Not doing so would encourage them to buddy up with other powers that are US adversaries which is not in the USs interest obviously.

Comes up after programs, temple shootings, far right rallies, etc.

israel is no exception. Daily ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is a corrupting government, poor economy and resource access. The extraordinary circumstances (killings, threats of international war, pronounced calls for Israeli genocide and public perception of Israel/israelis as complicit in national crimes) makes for the same sense of unease in the country.

it‚Äôs an unfortunate but very real Jewish impul

but just to highlight your point (or maybe implied point?) many Jews in Israel (not the majority) have immigrated there. If your country of origin isn‚Äôt hostile, you keep your original citizenship (it‚Äôs a very extreme process to formally renounce your citizenship from a country). So yes, say an American moved to Israel, they likely retain their us passport.

In 2022, Israel had 16 resolutions. 

North Korea, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Russia, Syria, Iran, US had 12 **combined**.

Saudi Arabia and China had 0 combined.

&gt;‚ÄúIn 2022, EU member states voted for one resolution each to criticize Iran, Syria, North Korea, Myanmar, the U.S. for its embargo on Cuba, and six resolutions on Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine. See second table at bottom, showing resolution texts and votes. By contrast, EU states voted for about 10 resolutions on Israel.

&gt;These same EU states failed to introduce a single UNGA resolution this year on the human rights situation in China, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Turkey, Pakistan, Vietnam, Algeria, or on 175 other countries.

&gt;Below are the resolutions on Israel that have been adopted, or that are expected to be adopted by UN General Assembly in 2022. We note that the chart below lists 16 resolutions on Israel. However, the resolution titled Assistance to the Palestinian People is more balanced than the others and is adopted by consensus. Therefore, it is deemed non-condemnatory.‚Äù

Name one"
k6zz2hl,Incorrect. Egypt blocked israeli‚Äôs shipping lanes which is an act of war. The arab nations started the wars every single time.
k6zz2gi,"Jesus Christ this video is full of misinformation. Doesn‚Äôt even go a full minute before saying something incorrect. 

1) The conflict predates 1947. The first wave of Zionist settlers came in the 1890‚Äôs fleeing Pogroms in Russia when the land was Ottoman. There was conflict with Arabs but it resembled more mafia style grudges, more personal not ethnic. Around 1920 is when the conflict became crystallized in Muslim vs Jew. In 1928 there was Jewish-Muslim riots where the Arabs purged the Jews in Hebron who had lived there for several millennia. In turn there were also Jewish reprisals. The violence only got worse in the 30‚Äôs, culminating in the Palestinian uprising in 1936-39‚Äô, to defend themselves Israelis formed the Irgun and Haganah. During WWII the leader of the uprising and other Arab nationalist leaders fled to Germany. They became even more antisemitic, especially as the Germans agitated antisemitic feelings through Radio Berlin. You can still see some of these hateful ramblings repeated to this day, some of it ended up in the Hamas founding charter. This was the state of affairs in 1947, an intensifying mutual hatred.

2) Jews Christians and Muslims didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlive in peace‚Äù until Israelis showed up. You can find many cases of anti Christian and anti Jewish violence throughout the millennia of Islamic domination. I don‚Äôt think if Israel established Sharia law except with Jews and Muslims switching places that anyone would be okay with it.

3) In 1948 there was a plan for a partition, but other than that everything he says is incorrect. First he uses the wrong map, that is the 1967 borders used for a 2SS, the original plan had a bigger Arab state than that. Second he says that the British did it, they did not.  The British were partially in support of Zionism in the 20‚Äôs when they allowed in many Jews who were fleeing the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe, but as the conflict became a headache for them they turned against it in the 30‚Äôs. They also allowed Arabs to migrate into Palestine as well. They banned further Jewish immigration in the late 30‚Äôs. Furthermore they had the Peel Commission which would‚Äôve have a tiny Jewish state at best. The Zionists turned against Britain and there was a three way conflict between the Arabs, Jews and British. During WWII, the Allies agreed to put all League of Nations Mandates under UN control, and Palestine was one of them. It was the UN who crafted the partition plan, not the UK. Their conclusion was that despite the communities being interconnected, there was so much bad blood that they couldn‚Äôt be in the same state and they created that partition plan. 

Now, despite what the guy says, the UK was not happy with Israel, from the 30‚Äôs until 50‚Äôs the UK and Zionists were in conflict. The UK abstained from the vote on the partition plan, and mostly sided with the Arabs. Their view was that Egypt, Jordan and Iraq were going to be their allies, and they were more critical for maintaining its colonial empire. The UK citizens hated Israel for how its militias assassinated British soldiers. There is actually an episode in this era where the French, Israelis and Syrians foil an attempted coup in Syria by the Iraqis and British. 

That changed with the rise of Arab nationalism. The Pro UK monarchies in Iraq and Egypt were overthrown by anti Western nationalists, and with the Suez Canal under threat the UK began to align with Israel. 

The USSR was similar to Britain but in the opposite way. They recognized Israel ASAP and they allowed the Czechs to export arms to rearm the Zionist militia. However when Israel didn‚Äôt turn out as Socialist as they liked and the pro Western monarchs were overthrown, the Soviets turned pro Arab.

I haven‚Äôt mentioned the US yet and that‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt play a big role early on. They didn‚Äôt have any troops in the region like the UK did and they didn‚Äôt arm anyone like the USSR did. That only changed later on in the 60‚Äôs with the Six Day War, for similar reasons to the UK I.e. aligning interests. Now they were also one of the first to recognize Israel, but that was more due to widespread sympathy within America. Zionists raised funds through sympathizers which was at an all time high due to WWII. The State Department internally didn‚Äôt want to get involved, but felt compelled due to public outcry. 

After that he seems to completely gloss over like 90% of the history. The Palestinian Liberation Organization is never mentioned, the Oslo Accords are mentioned once, Hamas is mentioned once, moreover he incorrectly says the chain of events being ‚ÄúIsrael blockades Gaza -&gt; Hamas is elected‚Äù when it‚Äôs ‚ÄúIsrael leaves Gaza -&gt; PA holds elections where Hamas wins plurality-&gt; Hamas attacks the PLO in Gaza and takes over -&gt; Hamas attacks Israel -&gt; Israeli-Egyptian Blockade starts‚Äù. 

Purposefully leaving out genocidal threats from the Arabs, any mention of a peace process, etc., is dishonest to say the least. You cannot get a clear understanding when you don‚Äôt even attempt to portray the conflict from an Israeli view."

k6zyvd7,Now let's get back to the 7th of October please and examine what has happened by your definitions
k6zyu6r,"1- it was legally acquired. I did mention that, Jews bought these lands from Arabs (who didn't really understand the grand plan , they thought it was a normal deal) 

2- the 1st option was 1936 peel proposal and it was rejected by the zinoist leadership btw (they only accepted the idea that they will get state but refused that partition). 

Arabs refused because they said that it was a betrayl to the promises they got from the British to govern palestine (after they helped Britain in taking down the ottoman) + the fact that the arabs owened 94% of the land and were at least 4 times the number of Jews. 


The arabs in 1936 called for an independent state of Palestine, ""with protection of all legitimate Jewish and other minority rights and safeguarding of reasonable British interests"".


BTW, israel wanted the whole area. Not a divided paleatine ... According to¬†Benny Morris, ¬†Ben gurion¬†and¬†Weizmanm they were thinking of accepting the 1936 plan and saw it ""as a stepping stone to some further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine""... in fact even 1947 was seen to be accepted and then to be expanded."
k6zyu2u,"If Hamas wins and gets their way Israel will be destroyed and the Israelis slaughtered.  The only Democracy in the Middle East will become Afghanistan.

k6zys8c,"I'm one of those people that thinks there is no military solution to the conflict. So if you fundamentally think the military on either side can bring real peace, then we can agree to disagree. Good luck.

I'm Egyptian. We and our Israeli friends realized a long time ago that there is no military solution to peace, often times this was strong military generals like Sadat/Begin/Sharon/Rabin that brought us there, not some poser corrupt politicians propped up by their terrorist settler friends.

No one is moving. They both have a right to the land and will at some point inshallah learn to live with one another in peace and fairness."
k6zyrxb,Can't believe this is present day and not my 3rd grade class learning about Anne Frank
k6zyrkc,"&gt;That narrative doesn‚Äôt exist ffs. Not among reasonable people. Reasonable people are saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bomb 5000 civilians because it‚Äôs evil and will only breed more fanaticism.

Reasonable people are saying, 'Don't let the terrorist group get away with its atrocities because it will do it again.'

Hamas doesn't give us any options besides disarming it and dismantling its control in Gaza. It has a cost because it operates from populated areas and uses the population as human shields. Until recently, we had the Iron Dome to keep our people safe; now, this is not enough.

None of those options can be executed quickly, nor would remain undetected by foreign intelligence. They are like a hawk when it comes to movements of anything nuclear. They would act before the nuke can be fired."
k6zyp99,"Sounds like it can get 80% worse, which is the majority and this considered much more."
k6zyp05,"I will try to adress all your points:

I as an arab also get daily racism projected towards me. From morning news to walking in the shop being followed by security. But i can keep two thoughts in my head. I can accept that there is racism against arabs and that there is against jewish people as well.

I have never read about soviet/russian or anti jewish propaganda from the Ford family, but will try to read upon it tonight. I can not discuss that point, if you have please link info.

Regarding apartheid.
I have relatives in Israel, arab AND israeli relatives. I understand you can not believe whatever you read on reddit, but since i have seen it irl then i know it exist. My arab relatives can not build buildings with concrete, all builded structures needs to be able to dis-assemble and relocated. They also can not build on new land wether it is theirs or if it belongs/stolen** by israel. They can not build upwards either. This is the reason (if you have been to Israel) that arabic neighborhood look clustered and their buildings are in chaos. I have been to Israel 20+ times and experienced this myself. My Israeli relatives on the other hand get free education, public trnasportation card, no issues traveling, no issues renting ex. cars etc.

The NAKBA means the catastrophe in arabic. The NAKBA is reffering to when palestinians (only arabic palestinians) where forced to relocate and/or killed. One of MANY examples is the whole village of Tantura where the IDF rounded up the Palestinians and executed them. This is documented and ex IDF soldiers has confessed. All ages, child to elderly, rounded up in cages and executed because they wanted to settle the village with jewish people.

Regarding Palestine historically:
Palestine was part and self governed under the Ottoman empire from late 1400-1914. Just as states in the US and districts/counties are self-governed. 1914 the brittish ockupied/annected Palestine and decided with zionist imperialists to take the opportunity and decide for a two-state solution.

Who would accept this deal? I wouldnt. And if it was the other way around, meaning if Israel was self-governed under Ottoman i would demonstrate against Palestine and the west for stealing the land and bluntly deciding on a two-state solution.

So in my opinion there was a state there before Israel and the people of this state can not be forced to relocate or killed. If you dont agree to this then:
There was a people living there before and they can not be forced to be relocated or killed.

And if they are relocated against their will WHY MAKE IT into Ghettos?


Lastly, 
Look at Ukraine used as a pawn in the imperial war between the superpowers west/east.
The US dont care about the Ukranians. The Russians dont care about the Ukranians even if they almost are blood brothers. It is all teritorial dispute.

When it comes to middle-east it is the same. When the US is done with resource and teritorial extraction they will not aid Israel anymore. They will leave just as they left Afghanistan, iraq, Ukraine etc. And we are the ones that will suffer.
The arabs and the jews. I believe the jewish people need to realise this and wake up from a zionist rule, and together with the arabs re-build what Palestine/israel once was.
Just as much as the Palestinians need to break free from a Hamas government."
k6zyoq7,"Well said, it is sad to see the world into madness and i hope the conflict will end rather quickly"
k6zyo42,Nobody wants all Jews dead. There are such thing as Palestinian Jews who have been openly vocal against Zionism for decades. There‚Äôs a reason jews ran to Palestine when the European continent were treating them horribly. Because they don‚Äôt have to worry about Muslim anti semitism. They are semites too and recognize Jews as people of the book who have protected rights in Islam since many prophets in the quran are Israelites. Why should they divide their land in half for colonizers??? Why should people have to move and make way for them? Is it the Palestinians fault your not safe in anti Semitic Europe?? Why take their land because of mistreatment elsewhere???

Israelis are in a catch 22, there are news reports everyday even in ""peaceful"" times from all over the world how someone hates Jews. When trump got elected white supremacist were marching chanting Jews won't replace us. Just a few months ago Kanye West said he loves hitler and suddenly a lot of African Americans started saying they are the real jews from the Bible and that the European Jews stole their identity. There is always someone picking on Jews.

So the only logical solution is a homeland for the Jews, no matter what the price is, but then when the Jews finally have a homeland , people chant free Palestine from the river to the sea. We're screwed. Palestine / Israel was chosen as the homeland for the Jews because of the historical connection, not because we hate Muslims or Arabs. Maybe it was a bad choice but it is too late now.

Here is just now a new example: 
https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1718686535514456105

I'm sure that Israelis and Arabs can get along wonderfully. There are Druze and Bedouins in the IDF that even the most right wing crazy extremist Jew call brothers.

It would be like England saying to Ireland - ok.  Take all your land back - you can do what you want with it.  Set up your own government, religion, laws, economy.

k6zy4c1,"A voice of logic: The reason why the sub seems to be supportive of Israel over Palestine

The reason why the pro-palestinian posts on this sub get downvoted and ridiculed is because the arguments are full of logical fallacies, false information, and appeal to emotion. This is a sub for debate, not propaganda. If you want your argument to hold water you better make sure it‚Äôs waterproof.

At the core of the pro-palestine argument is hatred and rage against Jewish Israelis for being the victors of the wars (against all odds) following the creation of the state of Israel and the displacement of the people (mostly Arabs) who chose violence over Israeli citizenship. Many first and second generation refugees are still angry that their ancestors were unable to successfully defend their land and were also unable to fight for it back. Their anger has fomented into hatred and rage has blinded the pro Palestinains from seeing and accepting reality. 

Are the Palestinains angry? Yes. Is Israel to blame? No. Is there apartheid or genocide or colonialism happening in Israel? No no and no. 

Conflict is the absence of dialouge. Israel has no dialouge with Hamas because they are blinded by rage and their positions are illogical. 

On the same token, there can be no progressive discussion until the pro-palestinians remove their antisemetic goggles and see the conflict for what it really is; a complex geopolitical situation involving the world‚Äôs major religions and highly invested political powers in the world‚Äôs most contested peice of real estate.

And even then, no kne will dictate to another nation''s army of to defend itself, thus Israel is making ground moves, contradicting your statement. ""

The world has collectively agreed that war crimes are illegal. Nothing about it is defense. We are not telling you ""how to win a war"" we are telling you to stop breaking international law. You don't like it? Then leave the UN and get ready for boycotts and sanctions. We don't have to support a country committing war crimes. The absolute entitlement in your statement speaks for itself. Every nation is held to certain standards Israel is not exempt. You can cry about it all you want but I don't have to do business with a country I don't agree with. Which is why Israel fears a boycott movement which is already starting to happen. 

The best thing Israel could do in this situation is stop bombing Gaza and open up negotiations. From the looks of it the IDF doesn't have a chance at taking on Hamas in ground combat. Every time IDF attempts to send troops into Gaza they are instantly forced to retreat. If you can't win a war the best thing to do is negotiate.

We always call BS on this idea because in our minds: more money = better. 

Also, Israel is incapable of fighting any war on its own. It needs massive airlifts of weaponry from America. It isn‚Äôt that Israel got lazy, but overtime their skills have atrophied and their occupation duties in the West Bank was all that they did since both Hamas and Hezbollah are not really affected by airstrikes. 

On top of that they are arrogant. And they also know now that America will always bail them out whatever happens. Why would you try and ensure a top-notch military if you know your big brother will just bail you out."

1. Israel uses or threatens to use Nuclear weapons on Gaza.
2. Proof that Israel **targets** civilians (**not** the same as **civilians die**), i.e. a situation where it is cut and clear that the **only** casualties of an operations would be civilians, yet Israel does it anyways
3. Israel continuing even after Hamas officially surrenders"

Scratch all of that. Did you see how hamas treats their prisoners? Is that something a terrorist would do? There are real interviews with them check that out.

Open the link and read. Jews and Palestinians are genitically related weather you like it or not. Israel wouldn't talk about Palestinians like animals if their intentions were to fught Hamas. You're also ignoring 75 years of genocide commited by the Israeli government and focusing on one attack from Hamas' side. Let's also make sure to not ignore the fact that Israel has killed 7000 Palestinians in the past week. If you aren't aware of what's happening let me explain it to you. Israel wan't to widen it's territory and is currently doing that by what it has always done, terrorizing civilians until they're forced to leave so that Israel can own more and more parts of Gaza. Half the population in Gaza are children, they didn't vote for Hamas nor did they refuse a two state solution. Hamas was founded in the 80s by the Israeli government to control Gazan civilians. They didn't ""vote"" nor ""choose"" Hamas, it wasn't a choice, they had no say in it. Gaza doesn't have a government, Gaza doesn't have laws. It's citizen's can't even rest by fear of being bombed. A two state solution would be a good deal if Netanyahu is taken down and if and only Palestinians are granted the same rights as Israelis, which means being able to travel in and out of Gaza, being able to live in Israel and having laws against discrimination. If you refuse to have Palestinian go back to their homes and treat them like human beings, then what you're doing is not in name of peace. It's colonialism. Everyone can live together just like they lived for thousands of years. There should be a Ceasefire and evacuation of ALL Palestinian civilians, only then can you fight Hamas."

k6zw65p,"Yeah, that's kind of the problem with this war. No one approves of what Hamas is doing, but we kind of get why the Palestinians would back them doing it, and no one thinks Israelis deserve to be attacked, but we kind of think their government's going overboard in response.

k6zw623,"&gt; It is hard to build a functional water and sewage systems for a population of 2+ million people out of PVC

I work with water distribution and wastewater collection in a city of ~1 million. Water mains up to 600mm are all PVC, and above that they switch to concrete. Wastewater is all PVC until they switch to concrete (not sure on diameter). Your statement is incorrect. Ductile iron pipes haven't been common here for at least 20 years"
k6zw5lc,"&gt;During the last year and a half of the Ukraine-Russia war there have only been 9000 civilians killed including children.

The concentration of people is completely different. Hamas is purposefully putting their weapons and military infrastructure near civilians and also hide their fighters as civilian losses. Ukraine is doing the opposite even though Russia hits civilians targets still. Ukraine also has hours prior warning to get to shelter and time to evacuate most people from front line areas. Comparing the 2 like this is foolish. 

&gt; In only 3 weeks, there are already over 8000 gazans killed nearly half are kids. 

Yes many are dying for the reasons I listed but I would also not jump into believing numbers coming from Hamas...

&gt; Israel is bombing all of gaza, your hate towards palestians surpasses ours towards you over a million times. 

Almost like Gaza elected these people to rule them and do not fight back as they put their rocket launchers in playgrounds and next to hospitals. So Israel should sit there and not hit back after being hit?

&gt; Don‚Äôt you see any videos of how palestinians are being treated in the West Bank? What about all the illegal colonies in West Bank. If Israelis are scared of Palestinians, why are there nearly a million living in the West Bank in illegal colonies? 

You say this as if Palestine hasn't refused a 2 state peace deal... Palestine attacked Israel and lost so they were occupied. They keep refusing peace and to keep whatever land they had then so they will keep losing more land.

&gt; You want all of palestine for yourself. Israel is treating us like animals, making us live through the worst conditions so that we leave Palestine. Israel is not a victim. 

Except one group had offered a 2 state deal multiple times while the other chants ""death to Israel"" and ""from river to sea"". One group has Muslims and Arabas living peacefully in their land being able to have positions of power in the government vs the other side which Jews would never be able to live in peace in. This isn't like if Hamas only targeted government or military centers..."
k6zw5hr,"The absolute dumbest thing about this type of action is that it hurts uninvolved Muslims so much. 

If you can justify hurting random Israeli civilians or Jews over the bombing of Gaza, the same twisted logic justifies hurting random Palestinian civilians over Hamas. These actions only embolden the Israeli government's actions.

This kind of thing is going to get far-right governments elected in Europe that will begin mass deportations and cracking down on the Muslim faith."

Egyptians are against what the Russians are doing in Ukraine. We are against what Hamas did and is doing to Israeli civilians. We are against what the IDF and the Ben Gvirs and Bibis have been doing to the Palestinians. Egyptians and many in the global south don't like the double standard in the West with ""international law"" or ""rules-based order""...but that doesn't mean we think the Ukrainians deserve to die because they're sinners.

Free Palestine for 95% of those that say it is about dignity, justice, fairness, and a future to look forward to for the millions of people under occupation today. I have a ton of Israeli and Jewish friends who think the same, regardless of what phrase they use. Just like the vast majority of Jews aren't interested in Eretz Israel with the Kingdom of Amon and Moab.

Antisemitism is poison. In all of its forms. If being critical of Bibi's Israel is antisemitism, turns out I know a ton of antisemitic Jews of all stripes. Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiments are equally poisonous. We only have a chance at peace when we see the Other and realize they laugh and cry just like us. Like Egypt and Israel have done, hard as it was.

I can spend hours giving you tapes of Jewish terrorists justifying rape, looting, murder, and burning. I choose to try and spend most of my time with people that think we're all equal though.

Most of us can understand nuance. Judaism and Islam and Christianity are fundamentally beautiful belief systems, every one of them. And every one of them has been used by terrorists to do crazy things."

The Arab position is more straight forward, but so structural as to even make mere discrimination a misnomer. .  By virtue of Islam, the Muslim world cannot err.

Its wild how this idea that the EU misled or never had intention of letting turkey join the EU has become treated as fact.

All nations who want to join the EU, turkey included, must fulfill and live up to 30 clearly stated chapters before any serious talk or votes to let a new nation become a member starts.

the average time to fulfill them all is 9 years, in over 20 years turkey only ever managed 2. It is not misleading or lying to not let someone who fails clearly states requirements in. Its on turkey for not fulfilling the requirements, not somehow the fault of the EU or some conspiracy to dangle membership in front of them only to yank it away.

How exactly would you feel if some callous person said ""*well actually, chum, Israelis shouldn't be mad about the murdered people from 7 October -- after all Israel started it by blockading Gaza and occupying+colonising the West Bank!

Israel do any thing to minimize gazan casualties (knock on the roof, messages and phone calls to evacuate, IDF spokesman), but hamas invest in tunnels( not for civilians), make people still stay by saying its zionist propaganda and bomb and shoot people who evacuate.

1. They are religious and they believe that's what god wants. Stupid, I know
2. They want to actively sabotage any diplomatic solution, and in that aspect, Hamas is playing right into their hands.

""  Israel is treating us like animals, making us live through the worst conditions so that we leave Palestine "", actually empirically, the more peaceful the region is, the more conditions are improved for the Palestinians (more jobs, more free passage of goods).

k6zv6rd,"&gt; because they never wanted to consider a serious 2ss at all regardless of how willing Palestinians were. 

I don't think the Palestinians were all that serious either.  One of the reasons I never considered the 2SS all that viable.  Any 2SS would either be horribly opposed by one side or majority opposed by both. 

&gt; opposed to the belief on the side of the Israeli right that Israel and only Israel has a right to the entire region

The Israeli right doesn't talk in terms of ""right to the entire region"" in the sense the left does. Right in their context means which one can form a viable state.  Palestinians in the refugee camps never tried.  Palestinians in the West Bank, did try for a few years but let Hamas and the 2nd Intifada undermine it.  And even then didn't do a great job.  Palestinians in Gaza never tried.   Whatever else you say about the Yishuv under tremendous adversity they tried and succeeded. The right looks at Palestinians and figures they don't really want a state. 

&gt;  ignoring the political issues won't make them go away.

I think it will.  What happened to Normans, Aquitaines and Burgunians?  Remove the systematic supports for Palestinian nationalism and Palestinian becomes an ethnic not a national identity.  Go further and it becomes part of the ethnic background of Israelis, a historical features.

&gt;  I don't think Israel wants a strong, sustainable Palestinian middle class, since that same middle class will immediately demand political rights.

You mean like what is happening with Israeli-Arabs as they are entering the middle class.  To be middle class generally requires a lot of  assimilation.  A society can tilt the field so that is even more true.  An assimilated middle class demanding rights doesn't endanger the system it strengthens it.  When the Irish demanded rights or later when blacks did it made American more in line with its ideals not less.  When a Zionist ethnically Palestinian middle class demands rights it makes Israel more not less Zionist. 

&gt;  I remember reading somewhere that the newfound economic status many Palestinians would find themselves in as a result of this hypothetical policy succeeding could serve as a carrot in a carrot and stick approach towards Palestinians for them to ignore political rights,

Yes that's probably how it starts, generally how it starts. 

&gt; The political and economic issues are fundamentally tied, I believe that was the position labor had which I agree with.

Of course.  That's where the populism is getting in the way.  Mizrahi Jews would be unquestionably somewhat undermined by this approach.  Though as time passes it is less threatening to them and potentially more threatening to Haredi Jews. 

&gt; Sort of like how Mizrahi jews and ashkenazi Jews aren't 'neighbors' in Israel, even though you might say Tel Aviv-ians neighbor Holonians.

They were friendly neighbors in the 1950s and 60s.  Then they started mixing for 2 generations and everyone is just Israeli.  Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, especially among the non-Haredi population are ceasing to exist as distinct populations. 

&gt; It is the right who moreso make the nationality in Israel be determined by race.

We disagree.  I think you are dead wrong on this.  Read some of the classic right.

&gt; As for the Iron wall there's an unmistakable degree of racial supremacy present there.

Don't see it.  If anything he is arguing the opposite.  *The enemy aren't idiots.  They aren't going to sell out their interests cheaply or easily...*

k6zv4jt,"Small reminder: Hamas leaders visited Russia a few days ago and agreed on the release of Russian hostages. Before that we had stories about Russia giving captured Western weapons via Iran to Hamas to frame Ukraine. 

Antisemitism was always big in Russia. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was allegedly made by the Imperial Russian government. Stalin shortly before his death imagined Jewish doctors trying to kill him and not a small number of Siloviki fucks believe that Jews ended the USSR.

And now this.

k6zux5f,"THE DISGRACE OF THE US CARRIER BATTLE GROUPS

Shortly after the beginning of Israel's intensified assaults on Palestinian civilians, the USA announced that they will be sending a carrier battle group to the region. I thought that, perhaps, the USA would tamp down Israel's evil attacks and start the process of helping the Palestinians in the open-air prison. The carrier ships carry an air arsenal that has the capacity to airlift MREs and supplies to troops in the battlefield many times over. I thought that when these American navy ships arrived, that they would immediately start sending humanitarian supplies for the suffering Palestinians, and keep the insane Israelis in check.

On the contrary, not only did they not send nor offer to send any humanitarian relief, come to find out that their whole purpose is to enable and support Israel in their continued human rights crimes against occupied Palestine. That if anyone dare get in that criminal government's way, they would be subject to attack by the United States military.

They're not even pretending to be an ""arsenal of democracy"" any more. Americans were supposed to be the most generous people in the world. But, in choosing to flex its military might in this ghastly manner, the United States has buried whatever was left of its moral credibility in Gaza's rubble."

Palestinians were pushed out of homes during the war and not compensated, but they kinda started the war?

‚Äî An anonymous redditor in his bedroom living in utter peace and well nurtured. 
Seriously what the hell happened to humanity. This is a vivid example of the American wack agenda of let‚Äôs pick a side game. 
The terrorist organization you‚Äôre talking about is fed and nurtured by Israel. Israel helped in funding and creating Hamas to counter the PLO the secular resistance group. If you read and dig down in history, you will have known that America and Israel‚Äôs main concern is the rise of secularism in the middle east. 
I will simplify things to you because 90% of this subreddit is pro-Zionist dumb individuals. 
You know that ‚ÄúHatred breeds hatred‚Äù right ? 
Extremism also breeds extremism; in other words: you can‚Äôt be extremist if there‚Äôs nothing that justifies and fuels your extremism. And this is how the USA created ‚Äú Al Qaeda‚Äù or ‚Äú Al mujaheedin‚Äù and this how they created ‚Äú ISIS‚Äù and so did Iran with ‚ÄúHezbollah‚Äù. The same case applies to Hamas that emerged as a paramilitary group after the first Intifada in 1987. The Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas, took full control of Gaza in 2007, ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces in days of bloody fighting, a year after Hamas won the Palestinians' last parliamentary election. 
Following its takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a tight blockade against the militants which has squeezed the Palestinian territory. Since their takeover, many protests took the streets in Gaza as many people were opposing Hamas which is something I am sure you never heard of ü§° and also since their takeover, the conflict took a major turnaround in which Hamas the extremist terrorist group funded by Qatar and Israel attacks incompetently causing casualties in the occupied territories; Israel welcomes the attack and retaliates with triple to four times more damage to the Gaza civilians who are already living in a prison in the most dire conditions in one of the most densely populated area in the whole world. 
Bibu and his Zionist regime strive on the existence of Hamas to justify their annexation agenda and their brutality and atrocities.

Can it still complain about war crimes bombing children near hospitals?  Sure it can."
k6zt8b3,"&gt; I‚Äôve read the relevant rules concerning allowing civilians food during a siege and I honestly can‚Äôt figure out how they might apply here in an asymmetrical kind of war without two military armies fighting each other in an area with civilians.

I found this [ICRC summary](https://international-review.icrc.org/articles/applying-principle-of-proportionality-to-sieges-914) very clear. The tdlr: 
* siege is legal, provided it is intended to secure a military objective
* it's unclear whether humanitarian aid has to be permitted in &amp; when
* the prevailing interpretation of IHL holds starving the besieged civilian population to be incidental to the military objective which a (legal) siege must have; this means that the principle of proportionality does not apply
* the ICRC is unhappy about this, and proposes a more restrictive alternative explanation, but that wasn't the prevailing law in 2021, and the law doesn't seem to have changed

In short, it seems that Israel's siege or blockade has a pretty firm legal basis, and the talking heads are talking out of... somewhere else."

k6zsmsg,"The Jewish people definitely revolted against Roman rule, and Romans had a responsibility to suppress the rebellion and save Roman lives. The Romans could‚Äôve handled it all better and so could the Jewish people. It ended brutally but not surprisingly. 

With that in mind, I agree with you that OP‚Äôs point about Israel being ‚Äústolen‚Äù from the Jewish people 2,000 years ago is not too compelling or relevant to the Jewish people‚Äôs right to establishing modern day Israel. 

That said - if I‚Äôm understanding your intent in asking the second question‚Ä¶ the Jewish people were upset about being ‚Äúmade into a diaspora‚Äù because they were relegated to 2,000 years of persecution. The solution to ending persecution against Jewish people is by allowing them to have a specifically Jewish country not under the control of Rome, Ottoman Empire, British Empire‚Ä¶ and so on. The Jewish people needed a country where they didn‚Äôt need to fear their own government will mistreat or scapegoat them because they will be seen as the ‚Äúother‚Äù or they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt belong here‚Äù - which is what happened a countless number of times.

To take this a step further and include *why* this Jewish country is in modern Israel‚Ä¶ their right to the land of Israel in particular has more to do with the Jewish people who lived there over thousands of years and the Jewish people who immigrated there from the 1800s until 1947. The region was under Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and then British rule‚Ä¶ and was never it‚Äôs own state since pre-modern history Israel. That said, there were many Arabs also living there during these times as well, and those Arabs needed their own land as well. With all these factors combined, it was a region that was perfect for the creation of an Arab state *and* a Jewish state when the need arose in 1947. It was decolonized by the British Empire, and redistributed to two counties that would exist side by side in peace and perpetuity‚Ä¶ at least, that was the hope until war was declared against Israel by the Arab nations and the dominoes fell and kept falling until **BAM** - we are where we are today."

To the French - majority of the land under international administration (which breaks promises to Arabs and Jews) and the rest of the land to the colonial powers (breaks the previous 2 promises) and also there was a catch - nothing shall be done to the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish population, which breaks the declaration for the whole 3 parties.

My bad 17 dead Hamas from all I could find from the now 8,000+ Palestinians since the night bombing.

Feel free add to the list."
k6zs0q2,"First off, it was a joke. 
Second off, they are imperialistic."
k6zs0qv,Parents are Palestinian? Are you dense?
k6zs0ng,"Well geez isn‚Äôt that exactly what Netanyahu and the hardliners have been clamoring for anyway? You‚Äôre making the exact case for all the people claiming it‚Äôs nothing more than a land grab. That said, what you are suggesting is considered a war crime. You realize that. Correct?"

k6zrzua,"Population growth.  How many Arabs in Gaza in 47? Less than 100k.  In 60 260k, today million.

Clearly not a genocide."
k6zrzpx,"Please, stop lying would you? My Arabic isn‚Äôt that good but I can clearly attest that they aren‚Äôt saying what you said!

Isra√´l and Jews are two different things!

Israel/Zionist of today use the name Israel and the Jewish religion as facade‚Ä¶

This isn‚Äôt about religion, never was and never will be‚Ä¶

I advice you to read the scriptures in their original language: Aramaic/hebrew/greek and see for yourself‚Ä¶

Who guided them to take the land ""back"" a prophet ? No‚Ä¶

They did this of their own belief and for their interest against God words!
They use the scriptures when it suit them and leave them on the side when it shouldn‚Äôt or change/alter them as they change clothes‚Ä¶

God promise them the land IF they followed Prophet muses and his brother Aaron! But only a small fraction did and the other became of the disbelievers‚Ä¶

Pharaoh had everything,(armies, money‚Ä¶) was arrogant, of the transgressor, a disbeliever who went as far as wanting to kill prophets of the lord ‚Ä¶

No long after he was eliminated him and everything/everyone that followed him, swallowed by the sea only for the pyramids left and his body as a proof/warning‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs what happen when god is on your side.

Now take Palestine, if god was on the Israelites side, why didn‚Äôt in 75 years, they didn‚Äôt manage to take their ""land"" back ?

Look at what they have:

Money/funding 

Weapons/armies 

And so on‚Ä¶

And yet nothing 

If this doesn‚Äôt remind you of pharaoh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What do you think will happen? What happened to pharaoh?

Exactly, and that‚Äôs why netannyu is in complet despair, because he know the end story, he know‚Ä¶ 



And in the 1880‚Äôs, their project of taking the land back was revive‚Ä¶

With the help of British and who‚Äôs not they after the war slowly but surely have been traveling to Palestine‚Ä¶

And around 1948, it became a hostile takeover!

Keep in mind that for CENTURIES, Jewish, Muslim and Christians have been living at peace with each their own beliefs‚Ä¶

Then the UN ""intervention""and the rest is history‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs just a little summary of what happened‚Ä¶

Do research yourself and see for yourself the truth

But if you start questioning things and don‚Äôt follow blindly, well let‚Äôs say that your safety will no longer be guaranteed and they will see you as an enemy‚Ä¶"

k6zrz7e,"Americans don't have an appetite for nation-building any longer, but airstrikes against terrorists with carriers we already have for exactly this purpose is pretty broadly popular"
k6zrysl,They also approve of the Ughur Turks genocide. Palestinan leader went to China to condone it.
k6zrynw,"&gt; Like I said, post 1948, it became a lot easier because Isareals existence fanned the flames of anti-Jewish sentiments.

So, plain ol' racism?

That's like saying 9/11 justifies European countries to kick out their Muslims."
k6zryfq,"Tbf idk why Israelis are going to Dagestan

As no Israelis are from there"
k6zrycd,They were told to evacuate the northern part but there are still being air strikes conducted in the southern part. There was a convoy of civilians fleeing south that got hit by an air strike.
k6zry9s,"Well, Israelis blame all Palestinians for Hamas so isn't it reasonable to blame all Israelis for their government 's actions? Just asking questions."
k6zry8v,Yeah this is new to me too
k6zrxxy,"It‚Äôs not that they were repurposed. You have the video from hamas itself showing you how they dig up the water pipes with excavators and make rockets out of them. They do not get just repurposed on entry into Gaza, they actively dismantle the water infrastructure to make the rockets"
k6zrxfo,"The only evidence of one side wanting the land of orhers are the arab nations that attacked Israel. The majority of israelites are not zionist just like the majority of Palestinians are hamas terrorists. Trying to blur the lines of peaceful native jews to zionist is very dangerous and disgusting 

The west bank is israeli owned land."

k6zruy0,"That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt give a shit about anything but their own and, surprise, many are antisemitic."
k6zrv06,Muslims living in the UK and America and so on are not ‚Äòcolonising‚Äô the land by being there. You can be anti colonial and move abroad and become a citizen of that country. It becomes colonialism when you‚Äôre taking control of a land that wasn‚Äôt yours. It doesn‚Äôt happen by becoming a citizen of that land/country and living there.
k6zruv9,"Just ask them what do they think about religious tolerance, individual freedom, woman rights, etc. Easy."
k6zrup3,They NEVER want to talk about Hamas and this is likely the people who never do want to talk about Hamas: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-tUkKtEBu40
k6zrtqp,"We are not silenced, not afraid and we are allowed to speak up, they just have a simple majority"
k6zrtq1,"Your country is indescrimately bombing a city of two million people. It's a genocide, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. You are European colonizers. Your country systematically removed people who were already living there just like mine did, just like England killed Irish people and razed their forests for cattle and starved my ancestors.

Hamas did commit war crimes, but Israel should not exist. Niether should have America, and I'm American. We are European settler land thieves and we have to deal with the sins of our ancestors and make peace with the colonized and decolonize, not slaughter them. (I'm from colonizers and great hunger refugees, descended from both an Irish rebel martyr and many warriors who fought the English for centuries, and an OG Puritan who owned slaves.)

Jews could have peacefully lived in The Holy Land if they didn't form an ethno-state. What happened post WW2 was evil, just as the colonization of the Americas was evil, just as the colonization of Ireland was evil. Deal with it. Don't support colonizer ethnostates.

I really don't see how you can look at what is happening in Israel and say ""Nope, no genocide here!"" Israel is killing people and taking their homes and land, that's genocide. Saying so is not ""siding with Hamas"". Hamas can go fuck itself."
k6zrsx6,"Yes, violent pogroms are sadly a common event in the history of the Jewish diaspora, from Spain to Persia they took place for over a thousand years. Your claim was that a million Jews were ethnically cleansed from Arab lands, which just isn't true. The Zionists wouldn't have had to go and recruit them if this were true on the scale you imply. Like I said, post 1948, it became a lot easier because Isareals existence fanned the flames of anti-Jewish sentiments."
k6zrsz6,Palestine Aligned with Nazi Germany.
k6zrsdq,"I don‚Äôt discuss with people that throw dumb to the air like nothing. You‚Äôre filled with any propaganda out there, while I‚Äôm here, sitting in a safe place hoping Gaza won‚Äôt hit my family."
k6zrsdh,"Hamas' charter:

&gt;The Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise, no matter how long that should take. The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said: ""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).

&gt;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.

&gt;Knowing the parties constituting the conference, their past and present attitudes towards Moslem problems, the Islamic Resistance Movement does not consider these conferences capable of realising the demands, restoring the rights or doing justice to the oppressed. These conferences are only ways of setting the infidels in the land of the Moslems as arbitraters. When did the infidels do justice to the believers?

&gt;""But the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians, until thou follow their religion; say, The direction of Allah is the true direction. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, thou shalt find no patron or protector against Allah."" (The Cow - verse 120).

&gt;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors."
k6zrrlu,Wow. That's actually quite powerful what you have written
k6zrrmi,"Right, I misspoke, I meant the 1949 Armistice Agreements borders, which were essentially the borders outlined in the 1948 deal.

I stand by the statement, that zionist have no intention on settling for a 2 state solution, that was merely a springboard to ultimately take more land. Eventually zionist want full control of Palestine.

Settlements keep encroaching on west bank. etc."
k6zrrdl,This is the reality of Palestine. They support Hamas and they support the eradication of Jews. They deserve no support
k6zrqxw,"You claimed the area near the border wasn't bombed, which I refuted.
I don't have access to that kind of data. Ask the IDF, they are the ones bombing the area.




Also when you mentioned a refugee camp before did you mean Nuseirat? That has been bombed though.

k6zrqfj,Turkey and the Ottoman Empire was more aggressive towards these regions so I‚Äôm not really sure how they could continue to exist otherwise being sandwiched between like that.

[This video from Vox goes over some of it.](https://youtu.be/a9FbqgOi-4g?si=iKF1gCDXzkV-Qd3k)

The region is trapped in a cycle of violence with different people on both sides perpetuating it. There's no road to peace when groups on both sides want to fight."
k6zroaw,The god damn tragic irony in all of this madness.
k6zrnxj,"In my experience, Palestine supporters rarely care about Syrians, Chechens and Uyghurs."
k6zrno5,"It doesn't. The supply wouldn't be needed had Hamas not turned their own system into rockets is the point they are making. Some feel it isn't Israel's job to supply them with water because of that. 

Does it make it right for Israel to deny them water if they are able to provide it? I would say no personally and it looks like they have come to the same conclusion finally. I can understand denying a lot of other resources out of concern it will just be used against them. Water and food though, Hamas is already hoarding what they need and will let civilians die in the street since it only helps them."
k6zrngh,"Not sure if you‚Äôre a believer, but praying has helped me with this. Knowing Allah SWT is the one we have to put our trust in and knowing that this life is just temporary puts it in perspective. In addition, having the belief that Allah has a bigger plan for those inflicting the injustice. After a rise, comes a hard fall.

Even listening to people like Sami Hamdi, Omar Suleiman, they‚Äôve helped me understand the bigger picture.

Charity is something you can help with amongst protesting.

The fact we are hurting for the people of Palestine should drive us to keep our voices loud and keep our prayers constant.

May the People of Palestine prevail and may Allah foil the plans of the oppressors. Ameen"
k6zrmwr,"There is no ethnic cleansing, its a foolish rhetoric that is easily disproven. I find it alarming that you think the natural human state is pre-meditated murder of women and children.

k6zrmq7,WW3?
k6zrmmg,Gotta love how people assume these are all ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù prisoners when most of them are arrested because they  attempted or planned to injure/murder Israelis. These are people like the literal head of Hamas who led the 10/7 massacre and would still be in jail were it not for a prisoner swap.
k6zrm4j,"This group is a legitimately dangerous cult-gang. They stand on the streets in New York City in the Bronx, talking about killing white people, and killing Jews and taking Israel. They scream at the top of their lungs on street corners about some non-history, mythical nonsense about having been ‚Äúoriginally from Israel‚Äù. As far as I can tell, it‚Äôs basically a hate group with a pyramid scheme, that takes advantage of poor and poorly educated young people. I used to live down the street from one of their main buildings in New York, and have seen it personally. I don‚Äôt know if they truly mean to commit violence, but they sure talk about it a lot."
k6zrlgx,You are being completely and utterly ridiculous. Should we here in Europe just start hunting down Muslims in our cities if a country does something awful?
k6zrl5b,It‚Äôs a totally expected outcome of Israeli war crimes and total disregard to the international community. I myself blame Israel.

So why Israel? It's not about humanitarian feelings, since more people are dying in other places."
k6zrj8y,Both.
k6zrirg,"Tactics like this aren't working anymore. I don't know if you are just a dumb person who carelessly posting about situations they don't know nothing about or you are willingly contributing to war time propaganda, anyhow i am not gonna deny this is doing damage to the Palestinian cause but i could assure it is limited in comparison to prior years. 

In previous escalations like in the intifadas and in 2014 yeah the narrative was totally in Israel playground. People  didn't even know what Palestine was let alone gave a dam. Today that doesn't exist, simply because Palestinians also got their own propaganda machine, a much better one."

I thought that was the problem they had with Israel?  

There's so many hypocrites on both sides of this situation.  People latch on to hate so easily and it blinds them."
k6zrgsy,"Arabs have perfected the victim mentality better than anyone in the world, and have no concept of equal rules for all.

The result is the concept that an Arab terrorists can slaughter Innocents and it's good, but when Jews fight back and defend themselves, they are committing genocide.

""Why would anyone attack us?! We've only supported terrorists since 2007! If you don't feel bad for us you're a racist!""

I feel horrible that children are being killed. But on a global scale this is the consequence of supporting terrorism."
k6zrgoq,There‚Äôs genuine debate about whether sieges are permitted under IHL. Basically it depends on which interpretation of the law you prefer.

k6zratc,"I'm Israeli. After Oct 7th, My whole body entered a constant survival mode. I felt that my family and me could be shot dead in the street or in our house any moment, and I kept getting insane videos of innocent Israelis going through a nightmare.

When I saw videos of bombed buildings fall in Gaza, I started feeling physical relief. I felt there's a strong power protecting me and my loved ones and that the Oct 7th terrorists, and any future terrorists, will know these acts are non-rewarding. Same for seeing the numbers of dead Palestinians going up. I'm sad to say this but it's the truth - I wanted to know that no terrorist will ever think these acts are beneficial in any way.

Today I saw more videos from the bombings in Gaza. I'm not a military expert, and I have no idea where is the line. But I know we've crossed it. The price is already too high. Seeing kids shivering, disconnected from their environment, covered with ashes.. And so many dead.. No military objective is worth it.

This needs to stop, now. Both sides have already paid such a high price. This is the time for a ceasefire, a hostages deal, rebuilding Israel's security and working seriously on a peace agreement."

&gt;Best known for her role in the 2013 film ‚ÄúWorld War Z,‚Äù as well as several Israeli TV shows, the actress was detained after **sharing images on Instagram of Yaffa Adar, 85, being taken hostage by Hamas, along with laughing emojis.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a second post, Abd Elhadi shared an image of Hamas forces breaching Israel‚Äôs security border, with a caption reading ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, Berlin style,‚Äù in an apparent reference to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The indictment also accused Abd Elhadi of celebrating the October 7 attack in a WhatsApp group with four of her friends. **‚ÄúGirls, have you heard the good news?‚Äù she allegedly messaged**, going on to celebrate the attack on the south of Israel, along with the kidnapping of IDF soldiers and ‚Äúpossibly also civilians.‚Äù"

k6zqz37,"Could this not go the other way around? The Israeli government has been illegally occupying Palestinian land and also has been keeping millions of Palestinians living in Gaza under an illegal blockade for 16 years. There‚Äôs also been multiple operations by Israel which have seen significant civilian deaths. There are thousands of Palestinians held by Israel who are tried by military courts, not the same courts as everyone else and there is evidence of torture and horrific treatment of these individuals, some people have even died so should they just sit there and accept that?

k6zqw3k,"Sure‚Ä¶but it has in no way roused the same wave of international fury (from every corner of the globe), that the Israel Palestine conflict has. And I think it‚Äôs important to ask yourself why: maybe because the free Palestine movement is not about the people at all. Its about the overwhelming belief that Islam should be the supreme religion, and that the Jews couldn‚Äôt possibly have claim to a land embedded within a predominantly Muslim region. Maybe it‚Äôs not about children dying, or even Hamas, it‚Äôs the deeply held belief that even while Muslims continue to benefit from western ideals, (and immigrate en mass to our countries), they simultaneously view western beliefs as immoral, and an affront to Islam. They call for a free Palestine, but don‚Äôt acknowledge that until Islamic extremist is eliminated, neither Palestine (nor the rest of the Middle East), will truly be free."
k6zqv0o,"Does anyone actually think this is going to work? Like come on can people be honest here? There is no removing Hamas. You could kill every last member, and the million kids who just watched 8000 of their countrymen get bombed to death are obviously going to grow up to hate Israel too. Even if Israel wiped out every man of military age, there will be tens of thousands more in 2 years who hate Israel just as much if not more (and who can really be surprised when they‚Äôre growing up in these conditions)."

Israel is criticized and will be critiqued for as it can do more things to make the life‚Äôs of the Palestinians better.

But if you taking about hope they could have had a state sooooooo many times. They have said no almost every time. Arafat could have had an Arab capital in East Jerusalem back in 2003 if he would have a accepted the two state solutions that was offered a gazzilion time.

Honestly, I don't blame Israel for not giving a shit about what the world has to say when the world has proved time and time again that they hate Israel for simply being Jewish. Israel is held to such a ridiculous standard that no other country is held to, simply on account of being the only Jewish nation in the world. 

The whole world said ""never again"" after the Holocaust. Oct. 7 was the deadliest terror attack in Israeli history, and the last time this many Jews were killed in a single day was in the Holocaust. Yet it took less than 12 hours after the attack before the Palestinians made it all about themselves and the world once again turned a blind eye to the Jewish victims *who are still being held hostage*. Apparently ""never again"" was a whole load of BS. It absolutely did happen again and the whole world is siding with the people who did it.

So honestly, if I were in Israel's shoes, I too wouldn't give two shits about the international community anymore because Israel could literally turn Gaza into the richest nation on earth and people would still complain about it being an evil plot by the Jews."

It mentions the Al-Quds hospital in the West Bank, which is nowhere near Gaza. It would be an enormous scandal for the Israeli government if Hamas was able to operate in the suburbs of Jerusalem like that, and it would make complete sense that the Red Crescent would be baffled at the idea of Hamas being able to operate there.

Just imagine for a second that you were under attack by another nation who massacred and tortured your people:

- Or would you pause halfway and say, ""wait a minute! Too little of our people have died, and we're not fighting fairly with them! Let's stop our offense until they are capable of killing more of us!""

Secondly, there are 460 million Arabs and 1,800 million Muslims in the world. Meanwhile there are only 16 million Jews. A ""proportional"" fight will result in 444 million Arabs, 1784 million Muslims, and 0 Jews.

k6zpl1t,"**Iraq:**

- In 1941, during an event known as the [Farhud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhud), Baghdad witnessed a violent pogrom where 175 Jews were killed, 1,000 were injured, and 900 homes were destroyed.
  
- Between 1950-1951, the Iraqi government passed an [emergency bill](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01151.x) allowing Jews to renounce their citizenship and leave. However, this same law stripped citizenship from those migrating to Israel. This made it difficult for Jews, especially those who went to Israel, to [return or regain their citizenship](https://www.jns.org/iraqi-officials-restoration-of-citizenship-does-not-extend-to-iraqi-jews/).

- The Iraqi Hashemite monarchy and the subsequent Baath party rule witnessed the implementation of laws that led to the [confiscation of Jewish property](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/constitutional-challenge-iraqs-treatment-iraqi-jews). Notably, Law 5/1951 specifically addressed the asset management of Jews renouncing citizenship.

**Egypt:**

- After the [nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_Gamal_Abdel_Nasser#1956‚Äì1957) by President Nasser, approximately 25,000 Jews were expelled from Egypt and 1,000 were imprisoned. This wave of expulsion coincided with the broader exodus of foreigners during the Suez Crisis.

- The year 1948 marked a distressing period for Jews in Cairo. Following the declaration of the State of Israel, Jewish areas in Cairo underwent bombings from June to September, leading to [70 Jewish deaths and nearly 200 injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Cairo_bombings).

- The geopolitical tensions surrounding the 1956 Suez Crisis and the 1967 Six-Day War were defining moments for the Jewish community in Egypt. Many Jews were either [expelled](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/the-second-jewish-exodus-from-egypt-629167) or felt compelled to flee due to the hostile environment. On June 5, 1967, Egypt began [detaining Jewish men](https://www.jpost.com/magazine/on-the-eve-of-destruction-494236).

---

**Syria:**

- Following the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Syrian government imposed [travel restrictions on Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Syria#Independence_and_Civil_War), preventing them from leaving the country. These restrictions were upheld until 1961.


- The Six-Day War in 1967 prompted the Syrian government to introduce [further constraints](https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/faq/judaism-syria) on its Jewish population, including prohibitions on Jewish travel and emigration.

---

**Yemen:**

- In 1922, Yemen's government reintroduced the [Orphans' Decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphans%27_Decree), an ancient Islamic law. This decree compelled the conversion to Islam of Jewish orphans under the age of 12.

- Between December 2‚Äì4, 1947, the Jewish community in the British Colony of Aden was subjected to a violent pogrom, known as the [Aden Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_anti-Jewish_riots_in_Aden). Triggered by the UN Partition vote, this incident resulted in the death of 82 Jews and substantial destruction and looting of their properties.

---

**Libya:**

- Between November 5-7, 1945, Tripoli witnessed a tumultuous episode, known as the [Tripoli Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_Anti-Jewish_riots_in_Tripolitania). Rioting escalated not just in the city but also in surrounding towns, resulting in the deaths of over 140 Jews. Many others were injured, and countless Jewish properties were looted, destroyed, and damaged. This catastrophic event plunged numerous Jewish families into poverty and left them homeless.

- On July 21, 1970, the Libyan government enforced a directive that sanctioned [the confiscation of properties owned by Italians and Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Libya#Six-Day_War_and_its_aftermath). Particularly, this law impacted Jewish individuals who had previously fled Libya, especially post the 1967 Six-Day War. Their properties, now seized by the Libyan state, undermined the economic foundation of the Jewish community. The ramifications of these confiscations have persisted, with property disputes lingering into the post-Qaddafi era."

i will tell you why. it is by design. unfortunately for the palestinian people trapped there they are being forced into a humanitarian crisis to make a point. 

israel is cutting off supplies to try to make the point that hamas has stolen and stockpiled supplies but isn't sharing them with the people of palestine. they are hoping that the people of palestine will turn against hamas when they find out that hamas has been hoarding supplies. this was an unbelievably stupid strategy from israel. because:

hamas is pushing the people of gaza into a humanitarian crisis as well. they are doing this to make a point. they are very effectively showing the inhumane treatment palestinian citizens are receiving from israel. that doesn't mean they are willing to share their stockpiles because those are important supplies for when israel begins a ground invasion. mostly the attack was meant to provoke such a response from israel that it can be used to turn the world against israel.

additionally, hamas caused a situation where their allies in the region (hezbollah, iran etc) would feel compelled to step in. they are hoping this will escalate and pull actors like egypt jordan into the fight. 

egypt and jordan are also using the gazans to make a point. i believe they are hoping the humanitarian crisis in gaza will turn the world against israel without them having to step in and take an active position. 

everyone is using the palestinians in gaza and they are getting fucked. they are getting fucked by their own government. they are getting viscerally fucked by israel. they are getting fucked by everyone else who isn't stepping in to help."

k6zphh3,"100% this.  


calling people who are against war immediately an ""anti-semite"" is the worst kind of person right now.  


If you are for Israel and for the innocent people who lives were lost due to Hamas, you SHOULD listen to people who want to advocate more diplomatic means that killing Palestinians in an indiscriminate way.  


Meanwhile the military industrial complex and possibly the oil industries are loving this war because this means profit for them. Know that by siding with Israeli's indiscriminate bombing, you are in a way supporting those industries. That's why this calls for more nuance saying ""pro Israel"" and ""pro Palestines"""
k6zpgmn,"&gt;Israel should work with the United States and Qatar to negotiate with Hamas to reduce the greatest amount of bloodshed and come to a two state solution.

So the US and Qatar should negotiate with Hamas? The same Hamas whose charter read:

&gt;The Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise, no matter how long that should take. The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said: ""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).

&gt;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.

&gt;Knowing the parties constituting the conference, their past and present attitudes towards Moslem problems, the Islamic Resistance Movement does not consider these conferences capable of realising the demands, restoring the rights or doing justice to the oppressed. These conferences are only ways of setting the infidels in the land of the Moslems as arbitraters. When did the infidels do justice to the believers?

&gt;""But the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians, until thou follow their religion; say, The direction of Allah is the true direction. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, thou shalt find no patron or protector against Allah."" (The Cow - verse 120).

&gt;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.

Oh, sorry. I forgot that they [softened their wording a bit in 2017.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/hamas-words-and-deeds#:~:text=In%20its%20original%201988%20charter,%2C%20religious%20or%20sectarian%20grounds.%E2%80%9D) But their actions have shown no change, only escalation.

k6zpbia," I have the answer to your question. The USA killed Bin Laden using special forces units without the use of jets or bombs from the sky, or even phosphorus bombs. I've mentioned this example before. If cartels in Mexico (we all know who runs Mexico) infiltrated the USA and killed civilians in Texas, how would the USA react? Would they respond by bombing the entire country of Mexico? Of course not; they would go after the cartels. Hamas is an organization, not a country. It's a conflict between the 18th-ranked country in military strength vs an organization with limited equipment and rockets made from water pipes and sand"

The aid issue is also kind of shameful because it's ridiculous that we are barely even able to bring aid to Gaza because of Israeli threats.

Dagestanis had waged a war of resistance that lasted thirty years before finally surrendering. I can't think of any other explanation as to why they are doing this but going by the title, they've got themselves paranoid and worked up over potentially being expelled from their homes over time and colonized again by another nationality.

Interesting to remember that the UN definition of genocide was the result of a looot of political compromise.

It was ultimately excluded because many of the drafting countries knew they would be guilty of genocide if it was included.

k6zod5y,"Exactly. So many people on both sides of the issue trying to frame it in a ‚Äòyou‚Äôre either with us or against us‚Äô way and painting it as a 100% black and white issue.

Israel: Has a lot more individual and public freedoms, relatively pluralistic society, but has historically adopted heavy-handed tactics on an essentially captive Palestinian population. Whenever a conflict like this pops up, the death toll is always wildly lopsided, including and importantly in the number of civilians killed. The settlement building where the Israeli state protects religious fundamentalists as they tear down Palestinian neighbourhoods to build their own over the rubble, is abhorrent and only inflames this never-ending conflict. And given the much stricter treatment in Gaza seems to correlate with a heavier and more extreme militancy there, it‚Äôs reasonable to question whether there might be *some* causal link, ie would doing things differently possibly lead to less extremism in Gaza?

Palestine: Are legitimately oppressed, imagine trying to make a decent life there. They are literally between a rock and a hard place, the Israeli state and their own homegrown oppressors. Have suffered decades of commonplace violence and destruction and a crushing lack of any real opportunities. On the other hand, they are under the control of a terrorist government. Now we can argue the relevance of their own responsibility in that, the last real election was almost 2 decades ago and half of the population are minors and therefore weren‚Äôt even born yet, but there is clearly widespread support for Hamas and the wider ‚Äòstruggle‚Äô. And that ‚Äòstruggle‚Äô being the unacceptable fact that there is a nation of Jewish people in the Middle East. And that is something that needs addressing too, the widespread hatred of Jewish people in the region. Some try to argue that the extremism of some Palestinians towards Israel is justified or explained by Israel‚Äôs oppression, but then what of the similar levels of animosity towards Israel in  Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and other Islamic nations who have even less contact or history with the state of Israel? They are not being oppressed by the Israeli state. So Israel is somewhat between a rock and a hard place as well, we can criticize their actions but it also seems like there isn‚Äôt anything they could do that would be accepted, Islamic nations don‚Äôt believe they should even exist at all.

Israel cannot just ignore what happened on October 7th, nor should anyone expect them to (notwithstanding those who clearly just approve of what happened, sadly there are many). But that doesn‚Äôt mean Israel is then justified in conducting wildly asymmetrical violence as collective punishment.

Nothing I‚Äôve said here contradicts itself, but there are many on both sides pretending that it does."

k6zo32o,"Don't let yourself be terrorized!

We all know that the crimes of the Izrael occupation forces, in their cruelty and scale, exceeded any predictions and concerns. In my opinion, the situation in Gaza today is similar to the situation in Warsaw during World War II. But the attitude of its inhabitants is just as heroic, just as adamanting and pure. When, in order to terrorize Warsaw, German butchers began mass arrests of random people and mass shootings of prisoners, the people of Warsaw killed their commander, and no subsequent German commandant dared to commit such terror. When the Warsaw Uprising broke out in 1944, the Nazis in the first days began shoot civilians from the ""Wola"" district in the streets, then they killed several dozen thousand people, to terrorize the insurgents. However, those freedom fighters did not allow themselves to be terrorized and stood their ground despite the betrayal of all allies (Stalin, Roosevelt). And when the bombs fell on them, they sang an insurgent march: 

""Let the wind carry song to the city

Like spark, flaming and bloody

Let it hang above on the heaven

Can you hear it burning Warsaw!

Let it flow in the streets that you know

in the alleys where the lilacs bloom no longer

Where houses turned into fortresses 

And hearts do not calm of entusiasm""

Today this song refers to Gaza, today your houses have turned into fortresses, from these fortresses bullets are falling on the occupying army. Today Palestinian civilians are being murdered to intimidate you, we know you cannot be terrorized!
One day, poems in every language will celebrate the sacrifice and heroism of the Palestinians, sacrifice for the freedom of all nations and the end of imperialism!

In recent years, there have already been cracks in my view of the world. But often, I could still try to rationalize things in my head. That's now truly over! It's so evident what's happening that I can't imagine that not everyone sees what I see. 

I check Instagram 24/7. Checking Motaz Azaiza, Wael Eldahoud and Ismail Jood to name some.   to see if they posted anything. Are they still alive? My heart starts racing anytime, and I feel the tears welling up. I can burst into uncontrollable fits of crying and anger. Sadness for what's happening to the Palestinians. Anger at how this disgusting world is put together. Disappointed in myself that I'm only now becoming actively engaged with my faith again.

But I also see the flip side. I see many people taking an interest in Islam! How beautiful, even if they only read the Quran and learn more about our faith. Perhaps it will connect us better to each other. Perhaps it will break the Islamophobia that the West has tried to indoctrinate.

We've told each other without words that we're waging an online war, haven't we? Because that's what I see happening. Israel is digging its own grave in that regard, and we are winning online! And that means we reach people who where maybe staying in the middle, or still thought Hamas is the only ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù. The narrative is changing!! So please continue to boycott and keep posting and sharing online! Even if it makes just 1 or 5 or 10 people think deeper about the situation."

Civilians can exert pressure on their government. Especially in this time of crisis. They don't either because they don't oppose the attack or they are not organized enough to show their dissatisfaction.

2) Almost 100% of the Jews have been driven out of their ancestral home owned by the Arabs while currently 20% of the citizens in Israel are Arabs and allowed to vote/practice Muslim.

k6zm6zk,"&gt; I don't believe in violence

But the indictment people make of Israel isn't an indictment of hopeless_optimistic, it's an indictment of the fact that Israel was created through the Genocide and expulsion of Palestinians that still continues today. No one likes violence, but its damn sure a strong mover.

I never said your needs/ wants were untrue, just that they're antithetical to the entire existence of Israel.

&gt; Of course Benjamin Netanyahu as our prime minister for the last 20 years is responsible for this, as well as Hamas

But this isn't just about Netanyahu. Netanyahu wasn't in power during the Nakba, he wasn't in power when Israel decided to fund Hamas, and so on. The zionism we're seeing today didn't happen in a vacuum. As you said, things aren't black and white. Netanyahu is a symptom of settler colonial state, not a seperate phenomenon. For every Bibi in the world, there are the police, legislature, judges, pencil pushers, and those in civil society who support it, and frankly, they're in power in Israel and always have been.

At this point in time, the likelihood of a 2 state solution is gone in the wind. Settlers are encroaching on what would be a future Palestinan state, the zionist regime protects them, and Gaza is being faced with genocide with Israeli politicians expressing a desire to colonize Gaza as well.

Any prospect of a two state solution was blown out of the water when Bibi and Gvir incited the murder of Yitzhak Rabin. There's nothing wrong with wanting a Palestinian state that would actively live side by side with Jews, but where is the Zionist government that has any desire to exist alongside Palestinians? It doesn't exist."
k6zm71q,"Israel sends money to Palestinian territories. You can look it up. Hamas uses that money for war and for their own pockets rather than using the money to build schools and hospitals. Gaza doesn‚Äôt have electricity because Hamas uses the aid money intended for electricity and water infrastructure for war and bribes. Gaza is autonomous. It is not entitled to free electricity and water from Israel, and yet Israel supplies it. Only after Gazans have killed over a thousand Israelis does Israel take away that free electricity. And why wouldn‚Äôt they? Why would they fuel terrorism against themselves? Palestinians have to go to Israel for (free) treatment paid for by Israeli tax money because Hamas refuses to build schools and hospitals to take care of their own.

Palestinians are oppressed. They are oppressed by Hamas and brainwashed by them. And you it seems have fallen prey to the propaganda."

Look at wars like the civil war in the Sudan, or the Tigray war in Ethiopia. I think we can all at least agree that the human rights violations there are too much. Even in war, nothing excuses that.

The world agrees. And they came up with agreements on what is too far, and unacceptable, even in times of war.  And they codified these things, in documents like the Geneva convention and the UN charter.

And because we have that, we don't need to worry about what Hamas did first, or what Israel did second. We can look at these documents and decide, independently of each other, that both Israel and Hamas are war criminals.

I keep hearing from Israel how hard it is to get water and aid in because of Hamas. Except unicef, the unrwa, the red crescent and MSF all seem supremely confident they can get it where it's needed.

k6zlutc,"I‚Äôve read the relevant rules concerning allowing civilians food during a siege and I honestly can‚Äôt figure out how they might apply here in an asymmetrical kind of war without two military armies fighting each other in an area with civilians.  

In particular because despite all this talk about ‚Äúblockade‚Äù and ‚Äúopen air prison‚Äù, the Gaza borders were open to freight (after inspection for prohibited weapons &amp; dual-use materials) and even humans with work permits on 10/6.

On MSNBC, a Gazan aid official said that before the invasion, 600 trucks/day came from the north from Israel and 100 from Egypt to the south.

I‚Äôm not sure reading these Red Cross rules of armed combat what happens during a siege if the supplies have to continue to come from the enemy across the front lines.  Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, especially since Hamas having done the planning and the attack could have built up stockpiles of food and water for civilians just like its stockpile of rockets.

Speaking of stockpiles, Israeli media inform us that Hamas has ‚Äúmillions of liters of fuel‚Äù stored in its tunnels and infrastructure.  This stockpile has never been mentioned on MSNBC. It needs these to power, among other things, portable generators for the lights and fresh air ventilation shafts/fans for the tunnels, without which they would become unusable.

The ‚Äúmillions of liters‚Äù claim by the way is based on intercepted communications between the hospital authorities and others seeking fuel for the hospital electric generators and ambulances.  The TL;dr of those voice calls (included with the article) is that the hospitals are desperate for fuel, Hamas is sitting on a huge stockpile and it‚Äôs not sharing with their civilians.

Not sure how bog standard ICRC rules applied to other conflicts like Ukraine apply, if at all.  There‚Äôs a serious square peg/round hole issue."
k6zluhj,"I think a ceasefire, or at least a pause in bombardment, would allow civilians to leave. Would allow aid to enter Gaza. From a humanitarian standpoint, a ceasefire would do a whole lot of good, and would likely benefit the hostages as well."

But people are trapped, starving, and losing their homes and it‚Äôs Hamas‚Äô fault. Israel has the resources and means of alleviating some of that pain and I absolutely think they should. 

How do you expect unarmed homeless civilians to exert pressure on Hamas. Don‚Äôt be naive.

k6zlpe5,"A UN decision took away half their land, they were fighting to keep it. It's unfair because the Jewish people living in Palestine at the time had (mostly) been recent migrants.this isn't the case of two nations living side by side for years and there being a new establishment of border.  This is very different than the partition between India and Pakistan as an example. 

People were also made to leave their homes (plenty of documented cases of violence being used for this) and the land and property left behind (which was then stolen) to this day hasn't been compensated.

Arabs in that region became Arab because over time they started speaking Arabic. This wasn't a foreign group who invaded it was slow cultural and religious change over time.

The issue is that the land was stolen and what the Romans did was unforgivable. But it was 2000 years ago, no one alive was affected by it and many Ashkenazi Jewish people are descended from converts to Judaism with little to no ethnic origin in that region.  I understand a sympathetic to the feeling that Jewish people needed a state to protect themselves. *But people were already living there*, there was no way for this to be achieved non-violently.

Videos of mobs hunting down Jewish people based on rumors will not help. This will be used as propaganda by Israel as proof that a Jewish state needs to exist due to antisemitic sentiments. Russia simply wants to use Palestinian people as pawns in their geopolitics. They don't actually care about human rights.

Also, if anyone country is to blame, why would it he Germany and not the United Kingdom, which was the old colonial power of Palestine? Zionism predates both World Wars as an ideology. The Holocaust did not create zionism."

Also, why would Hamas agree to release the hostages right after kidnapping them? This is not about revenge, it's about making sure Hamas can't do anything like that ever again. The first priority of the war, as much as it hurts me to say, is to destroy Hamas, and after that to return the hostages (that's at least what I've read in some news articles).

Because if Israel negotiates to return the hostages, It's only gonna encourage Hamas to do something like that again, they will get their terrorists back."

But now their is a perception of genocide ( it doesn't matter what you think it matters what Muslims perceive), and more assymetry in deaths will only increase this perception.

Pros.
1: we can just storm Aza hamas may want to believe they can stop us but they overestimate there power we can go in once we make preparations ( bombings) .
2:They can't execute the hostages they already holding any kind of Western empathy left and if they do Israel will just become so blood thirsty they will wipe the strip in a day ( and yes Israel has the fire power) .
3: if I give in I'll be viewed as weak and people will take advantage of that
4: point 1+2 point the worst situation hamas is the terms will be in our favor in our negotiation.


Cons: your assuming that as Bibby I'll have a moral campus well no I won't .

Look we want or people and families back more then eny outside person our group but on a national level there's a need to act against hamas which takes priority that's the sad and cold truth .
We want them back and it's a very difficult situation it may seem black and white for you ( simply all for all ) but like the entire conflict it's a very complex situation . 
For example have you name checked the nemes hamas wants to release and who specifically they are aiming to release or if Israel ever used there safety as a threat  to gain something ( Hamas did
Can we even guarantee if the hostages are even alive
( we have almost zero proof which doesn't go back specifically to the 7 ) .
Will they honer there agreements ( long history of immediate breaking agreements.
250\6000
And to finish it will also require to stop the war which will mean a big lose for Israel and victory for them.
So think please we all every good person wants peace but we must not lose our rationality it's an argument of cold logic versus emotion ."

k6zljcd,"Not true. Most of the deals have been a smaller portion for Israel and Jerusalem being an international zone. Most were very fair and some were opposed by Israeli citizens for giving away too much. Also, of course they would not allow Palestine to have a military, are you insane? They would immediately break the peace deal and use their new weapons to attack Israel. They would HAVE to be demilitarized. Look at Japan after ww2. Their culture, same as Palestinians, told them it was honour of die for the cause. They were planning biological attacks on civilians. The allies realized their military had to be dismantled for peace to be made. It worked. Look at Japan now, you couldn't even recognize it as the same nation that committed the worst human rights atrocities in history. Regardless, only 24% of Palestinians support a two state solution so it doesn't seem likely that will happen in the near future."
k6zlj53,"Israel could attack a US ship (again). It may be forgiven one time. But, if Israel attacks and kills one more US personnel, it's done for. As far as I'm concerned, US should cut its alliance immediately at this point, if not go to war with Israel."

If there would be a right to return, than it has to be applied to all refugees, regardless of color, genre, nationality or religion.

[12 million Germans](https://www.dw.com/en/what-germanys-postwar-refugees-taught-us-about-integration/a-18575558) lived peacefully until the end of WWII in the territories which are now Poland today. They were born there, they had houses there, they lived an honest life there.

After post-WW2 redesign of Germany borders by the Allied Powers, German refugees were forcibly expelled from their homes. This was the largest single instance of ethnic cleansing in recorded history.

They left all they had to a Germany devastated by WWII, with no food or potable water. They were in refugee camps (some lasted until the 70s), but slowly, they managed to get jobs, jobs led to a stable life and a stable life led them to prosperity. They moved on.

If we start having right to return, German refugees (or the descendants of refugees) would have the right to claim Polish lands and so a war for these lands would possibly ensue.

No to the right of return, it will only make the war to last forever. And stop funding Palestine, because funding is only going to terrorism.

Palestinian refugees have to work to get a life, like the German refugees did, instead of relying on permanent UN aid."

k6zkwss,"&gt;Seems like clearing HAMAS out quicker so civilians can move back and rebuild would be better in the long run

You may be right, but the massive humanitarian catastrophe that would cause was something that the International community was unwilling to tolerate apparently. 

Israel's initial goal after the terrorist attacks was Regime change in Gaza.  They were openly messaging a full bore invasion to depose the current government and implement a new one. 

However, There are two really significant problems with this:

1. HAMAS and its more extreme cousins are well adept at hiding within the 2m+ population of the Gaza strip, and any attempt at an actual occupation would be littered with unwinnable situations where Israel has to choose between effectively prosecuting the war or causing civilian casualties that will be used against them.  (Hence Israel's demand for all 1.4 million civilians in NOrthern Gaza to evacuate - which was a virtual impossibility, but it would have given them freer hand to strike at threats where they saw them).  I think even policymakers knew that if Israel were accused with casualty counts of Civilians for every strike, every day of the war, it would quickly become unwinnable. 


2. Suppose Israel is successful. They invade the Gaza strip, impose martial law, and begin preparations for a caretaker government and democratic elections.   How does Israel get out?  They have de-facto returned to occupying the Gaza strip.   The last time they occupied it, it lasted from 1967 to 2005, and the withdrawal was terribly complicated for Israeli forces. 

I think policymakers in the US and EU are very sympathetic to Israel's problems, but they were unwilling to contemplate a renewed occupation of the Gaza strip as a reasonable solution.  Particularly when that risked a larger regional conflict. That basically leaves two military options on the table:""

1. A surgical set of missions to drive HAMA fighters out of a portion of the strip and withdraw. 

2. A larger operation seeking to de-fang HAMAS entirely, but then withdrawing and largely leaving Chaos in its wake.

Meanwhile Conservative media in the US was selling that Israel is in danger like it was in 1948."

Most Arabs are good at talking smack and not backing it up, they overrate themselves so much it's embarrassing, it's why Arab armies are only good for massacring unarmed civilians, just look at Iraq having infinite resources and still not being able to take an inch of Iran, who literally had the entire world against them in 1980-88, just look at the ISF and how easily they crumbled against ISIS in 2015, Saudi Arabia begging the US to stop Saddam in 1990 because they were next after Kuwait, knowing their army can't do shit, and of course, literally every one of the Arab-Israeli wars.

As a young teenager of 13 I remember by uncle who lives there describe a day he was in a very Jewish side of town (he is Modern Orthodox) and got either harassed and/or assaulted. He tans very easily and was mistaken for an Arab. The story seemed to simply be brushed under the rug as if to say, ""Ey, well it is what it is."" Never to question why would my uncle was assaulted for the mistaken identity.  


In high school I was still attending Jewish study once a week until 16-17 years old. Classes during study ranged from learning about the Old Testament from different perspectives (religious &amp; modern), Hebrew study, and Jews in the news/media. You can guess which class was full of propaganda. We were shown photo and video footage of towns in Gaza and in the neighboring settlements being bulldozed, obliterated hospitals and schools etc. All to be told houses were bulldozed because they ""had to"" and buildings were destroyed by terrorists. Going as far to say terrorists placed dozens of already dead bodies in the buildings to make it look like people had died. 

  
Before entering university I didn't know what I wanted to study however the idea of joining the IDF sounded like a good idea. I had had Israeli's and Israeli soldiers visit us in the states and many of them all had the same outlook on the decades long conflict; the Jews were the people who by some miracle survived all the genocide and atrocities, we were the ones worth protecting at all costs.  


In university we rebooted a Jewish fraternity on campus that hadn't been around since probably the 70s. On campus the Muslim Students Organization set up an Israel Apartheid Week taking place. From all of my upbringing and study this phrase ""Israel apartheid"" was totally foreign. It was to be automatically assumed the students who organized this week of protest must be far right extremists who wanted to exterminate Jews. Our fraternity, along with Hillel (Jewish student organization) created a counter protest to theirs. I remember a lot of shouting from both sides but especially our fraternity president (who moved to the states from Israel in high school). He was especially fervent with calling out the other side. In my optimistic naivete I wanted to do something. These yelling matches weren't helping anyone. I was studying screen printing so I had the idea to create a shirt that combined the word for peace in Arabic and Hebrew. The word in each language not only sound similar ""salam"" and ""shalom"" but even look similar in character when written in Arabic and Hebrew (who woulda' thunk!) From a design perspective it was easy to combine the words and looked great. The shirts served a small purpose. To try and mend things my brother screened a movie at Hillel, inviting everyone but especially the students from the Muslim organization. The film documented both sides of the conflict, families who lost loved ones and how they were dealing with it all. There was open discussion afterward and I specifically remember (once again) or fraternity president getting worked up over his opinions and that of the Muslim org.   


This same president from our fraternity would later go on to shame my brother for writing an article on the apartheid, essentially calling him a traitor to his people and claiming he along with his wife are radicals.  


Flash forward 10 years. Information is even more accessible than ever. My father received an email from our relatives who live on kibbutz.

""we are very sad and angry and seek revenge although¬†it won't help those murdered in poisoned blood by pure evil.my eyes are shedding tears the more we are exposed to the horrors carried by the human animals hamas. nothing will ever be the same again . neither the state of¬†israel nor the gaza strip. the state of israel was established after the holocaust so that jews could live safely in their homes .the terrible failure that occurred must never happen again . israel defense forces with all the citizens of israel will make sure that such disaster cannot happen¬† again .with the help of president¬†biden and the united¬†states of america take care of yourself.""  


Note my relative does not call Arabs/Palestinians ""human animals"". This is because they are ALL viewed as ""Hamas"" through the lens of certain Israelis and Jews. This is not a sweeping assumption I came to over the last couple of weeks. It is something that has been indoctrinated into me from a very young age. And over the past number of years I have fortunately been able to shed.   


If you have gotten to the end, thanks for sticking with me. Please ask me any questions. I don't consider myself an expert however my perspective I find crucial in understanding what is going on and why so many are for and against this fucked up situation."

k6zkfu0,"&gt; she ended up in Gaza hospital - how do you know that Israelis did not shot her and Hamas just took her back to hospital and to hold her as hostage

Because she is clearly dead as a doornail in that video. You need broken bones to lie like that. The fact that people told her mother that she was alive was just further terrorizing a grieving and desperate woman. 

You really, really, have to be **deeply** brainwashed if you don't believe that hamas killed civilians...

Here is a conglomerate, which I assume you'll disregard because it's published by the IDF. I went looking for the footage of hamas tossing grenades into the bomb shelters at music festival. If you don't want an IDF source, you'll still be able to find the footage of the grenades but I aint doing more research for you because I think you are too far gone: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAFDI63yvNQ&amp;ab_channel=IsraelDefenseForces

It‚Äôs only the focus on this world and this life. The Jewish trauma and loss of life during the Holocaust is deeply imbedded in Israeli culture. It sounds insane to you to trade a thousand people for one soldier, but the country demanded it. For years it was we will do ANYTHING to bring him home. And Hamas took advantage of that.

Yet your equation of indiscriminate bombardment = ethnic cleansing does not compute. That's like saying 1+1=4. The bombs are not intended to kill as many Arabs as possible, or they would be falling in different locations than they are now which would have your suggested effect.

Yemen on the other hand barely had any media coverage and therefore the world didn't put a ""high value"" on them. 

Palestinians for example are valued ""way more"" today than before because the media coverage finally tipped in their value for the first time ever.

k6zjgw0,"Hamas is an Islamist Antisemitic and genocidal organization that has actively sabotaged any peace talks. They are the Muslim Brotherhood branch in Gaza and originally weren‚Äôt primarily a militant group, but a charitable group that worked with Israel. They did eventually start fighting other Palestinians who were secular nationalists at the time while Israel stood by, but when it was clear that they weren‚Äôt going to win support for that they turned hardline. They formed Hamas in 1987 with a Founding Charter that references multiple antisemitic conspiracy theories and proudly announces their intent to kill all Jews alongside other charming beliefs such as that women should stay at the home. 

They joined the PLO in its fight but then turned against them once they started peace talks to actually end the conflict. They tried to derail them by launching suicide attacks against Israel causing the PLO to crack down on them. Once the Peace Talks fell apart the PLO released their senior leaders as attack dogs and that ended up getting them kicked out of Gaza after Israel ended its occupation of Gaza and evacuated all its settlements within Gaza. Hamas then used its rule of Gaza to attack Israel and prepare it for Total War. In response Israel blockaded Gaza. 

Hamas isn‚Äôt a mere resistance group, they are like ISIS. They do not differentiate between civilian and military, not even their own. They purposefully put Gaza into the situation it is in right now and they‚Äôre not shy about their feelings about Gazans, they say that it‚Äôs better for them to die for the cause than to live in Gaza and that the Gazans are still willing to ‚Äúpay the ultimate price‚Äù for their freedom. They purposefully attack near civilian infrastructure and target civilians, they sacrifice their own people because their deaths aren‚Äôt inherently a bad thing to their while their militants are safe underground and their leaders are in luxury in Doha. All of this is for the end goal of the genocide of Israelis, and a global Islamic Caliphate. These aren‚Äôt mere resistance fighters like Fatah, these are genocidal Islamists. 

They would have kidnapped, murdered, raped and paraded the corpses of the people going to these Free Palestine rally‚Äôs because that is exactly what they did to the Peace Festival.

Say what you want about Israel, but they tried peace, they tried negotiating, ending occupation, removing settlements, hell they even allowed Gazans right before the attack into Israel to work to help the economy of Gaza. I do not know what the Pro Palestine side wants other than Israelis to kill themselves."
k6zjg0u,What a ridiculous excuse. 3000 innocent children dead. That is not on Hamas. That is squarely on Netanyahu and the IDF. A crime for a crime is still a crime.

k6zje0h,"In May 1948, almost one million Jews lived in the Arab world. Today, fewer than 8,000 remain. When the State of Israel was founded in May 1948, the Arab regimes took revenge on the Jews.

Today, all refugee problems from before the 1950s have been solved. All except one - Palestinian.

The UN claims there are 5.6 million Palestinian refugees. According to the international definition, refugee status is only applied to the first generation of refugees. However, the UN makes an exception for one group: the Palestinians. Descendants of Palestinian refugees are given the same status as their ancestors. Therefore, the number of so-called Palestinian refugees rose from 710,000 in 1950 to more than 5.6 million now. 

The real reason? These Palestinian refugees are used as a demographic weapon against Israel.

The 1 million Jewish refugees from the Arab world did what millions of refugees have done throughout history. They started a new life elsewhere. There are no Jewish refugee camps. Imagine if they would claim they are entitled to land in Morocco, Egypt, Syria and Iraq because their grand parents lived there 70 years ago.

And if you would look at the history of Palestine, you would find East Palestine (now Jordan) was given by the British to the Arabic islamitic Abdoellah bin Hoessein. In other words, the Palestinians already have their Palestinian state: Jordan!"
k6zjdi8,"No Arab country wants Palestinians because every time they try, they start causing problems there too.  Just ask the prime minister of Jordan who the Palestinians assassinated."
k6zjd8f,I'm guessing its the Russian Jews they are after?
k6zjct2,The numbers are so absurd that the only reasonable explanation would be that this wasn't the actual trade - maybe there were other objectives
k6zjcpy,"Lots of different groups in Israel too. Many are horrified at how settlers, the IDF and government behave."
k6zjc1f,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; because we care more about greed and power than we care about the people who actually keep us alive 

Who is 'we'? The overseas actors in this conflict? USA? China? Iran or Russia?

Idk about you but just as many Israelis, I have relatives and friends in army service, I pray for them every day and night. They serve to defend Israel, because if they don't, atrocities like October 7th happen. The purpose and goal of our enemy is to eradicate us. Its a war of survival, not greed and power.

About war crimes, there is no such thing a clean, sanitary, 'surgical' war. Where there is war - there will be war crimes. Ethics of war are being applied in order to minimize them.  When the methods of war are violence, death and destruction, how can you expect it to occur with 0 collateral damage? This may only be a reality when robots will fight our wars, but the probably they will turn on us because we are stupidly busy fighting each other so nvm.

This violence happens only because diplomacy failed, time after time. Israelis will say its because of Palestine, and Palestine will say vice versa, but as I see, it doesn't even matter. There is a fundamental reason why diplomacy constantly fails in this conflict. I guess you can blame both/neither sides."
k6zjbny,"What do you mean by ‚Äúnot their land‚Äù? It was no one‚Äôs land. Palestine has never been self governed. Both Jews and Arabs have always shared this land. There were both Arab and Jewish villages. Tel Aviv for instance is a Jewish city and was founded in 1909, almost 40 years before Israel was an independent country. 

Jews agreed to share the land, Arabs refused and started a war. Not that it‚Äôs relevant to the discussion, the people Hamas has butchered on October 7th are there for at least three generations. Took a mortgage, bought their house legally, didn‚Äôt steal anything from anyone."
k6zjbb3,"Sorry your precious little heart doesn‚Äôt understand what war is. War is ugly. People die. Unlike Hamas though Israel doesn‚Äôt target civilians and goes through great lengths to prevent civilian casualties. No nation throughout any point in history has done a better job at avoiding civilian casualties than Israel. 

There is a reason organizations study them to learn how to avoid civilian casualties in war."
k6zjb9c,it is a tragedy ..poor guy
k6zjaol,"&gt; No sir, Jews are people of religion and worshippers of god. The Zionists are the post ww1 German imitators, not the Jews. The Zionist is a hyper racist anti semitic movement started by Christians in Europe."

k6zja8t,Why would America not lie to you
k6zj9y2,"&gt;Not really a thing, the local aquifer already suffers from overdrafting, not that I think Gaza has the means to extract it anyway.

It's their local extraction that has been exceeding local replenishment of the aquifer for many years, leading to a low localized water table and seawater intrusion which has rendered the well water under much of the Gaza strip with salt levels that exceed WHO specs for drinking water.

Last data I saw was 2020 which said they were extracting the equivalent of 230L per Gazan per day, about 3.5x local replenishment rate"
k6zj9o5,Wait why would Israelis go to Dagestan? Was it a flight to Moscow that had to make an emergency landing? Or was it just a rumor?
k6zj9jx,"I don‚Äôt think that Israel should‚Äôve been formed in 1948. But I don‚Äôt think you can answer one ethnic cleansing with another ethnic cleansing. There has to be a Two state solution. I think Israel should absolutely return to the 1967 borders, dismantle all settlements, etc. 

You want another ethnic cleansing."

k6zj76b,"Because he was alive? I don‚Äôt know of any other living soldiers Hamas has taken hostage, prior to October 7th.

It was a take it or leave it offer after 5 years in captivity. In retrospect it made hostage taking that much more appealing I think."

k6ziyvk,"I never said Israel wasn‚Äôt justified.

And stop, you know as well as I do that the civilian population in Gaza has no access to Hamas stockpiles Especially since the ground invasion. Also, don‚Äôt pretend Hamas is truly representative of the will of Gazan population. There hasn‚Äôt been an election in almost 20 years, Hamas barely won in 2006, and has a monopoly on violence.

k6zia4r,"I don't think that ""queers for palestine"" has ever represented the mainstream LGBT community tbh"
k6zi9c5,"That stat doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have the overwhelming support of the people. In any election held today across all of Palestine, West Bank included, Hamas would win. 

And even with the point you were trying to make, another large percentage supports Islamic jihad which is even more radical than Hamas. 

Don‚Äôt for a second think the majority of Palestinians don‚Äôt support terror. All it takes is looking at the pro Palestine protests around the world to see the vitriol hatred these people have for Jews."
k6zi986,I‚Äôve never read something that summarized a group better than that last sentence. God damn that was good! üòÇ
k6zi8qn,"Israel is located in a very strategic place geopolitically. The resources in neighboring countries are immense.

My theory is that USA and Israel will establish new ground to colonize and expand their territories."
k6zi8fy,"Dude, if the Ethiopian Jews have been Jewish since literally ancient times, they're ethnically Jewish. 

BTW being an ethnicity has more to do with your cultural linguistic background than your DNA. If your community speaks Hebrew and has celebrated Judaism for over 1,000 years I think it's safe to say you're ""ethnically Jewish."""
k6zi8dk,The difference is Germany wasn‚Äôt occupied and colonised for 75 years. I guarantee you you‚Äôd be a ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù if another country occupied 90% of your country.

Post 70s we had a pro America Iran and then because of our relationship with Israel Likyd party America was labeled ‚ÄúThe great Satan‚Äù and again for what? Oil? Would‚Äôve had that. Land?

k6zi6s7,"This video is NOT the full recording of the encounter between former Israeli ambassador in Italy Dror Eydar and the announcers and guests of Italian TV programme ""Stasera Italia"", but the rest of the recording goes along the very same lines and Eydar never seems to back down on his atrocious declarations.

This video is proof of the intentions of the Israeli state, if the facts of these days and of the last eighty years hadn't been enough already."
k6zi6nu,Well Egypt has a massive fucking river called the NILE River running through it. It is also somewhat of a stable country.
k6zi5yg,"100% agree, that movement could've easily been involuntary. I am just not convinced it was from checking or getting check by another player. What a fucking tragedy, the full video of him skating off the ice is insane"
k6zi5nw,If they killed every citizens for no reason they would have no more support. They are making excuses for it right now though to defend themselves and tell everyone they are in the right.

Dude. Wtf. They are making fun of a genocidical idiot. Now you are going to say that puting for them many mamtera is the same right?"
k6zi44q,"&gt; Look, I can't stop you from believing what you want to believe. 

and you cant stop lying either apparently"
k6zi455,"No I don't think I know.

It's not neutralizing the entire civilian population. They gave them a warning to leave and most already left. They have a casus belli to invade and to pound Hamas terrorists. If you have objections, forward them to Hamas bureau of rape and ask them why they did what they did."
k6zi40x,"This thread is full of liars. 
Each time I interact with any of them, I get how dumb and delusional these people are. 
Also yall have 3 sources and they literally show how dumb yall are 
1- CNN - FOX - BBC type of shit 
2- Telegram Channels or groups: Anyone can spread shit on Telegram with 0 factchecking 0 censorship 0 credibility and it‚Äôs spread by people with varying agendas
3- IDF clips ü§° top notch manipulative shit"
k6zi3jk,There are a wide variety of reasons this conflict gets more attention. Israel is by far the most powerful country in the region and is allied to most westerner‚Äôs home countries. It‚Äôs a lot easier for media to cover conflict in Israel than in Syria or Yemen. I don‚Äôt think this is hard to understand.
k6zi3he,"We were talking about financial resources, not the number of mostly poor Muslims around the world."
k6zi3jf,"Lol you didn‚Äôt answer the above posters question about Israelis who are born there, because you can‚Äôt."
k6zi2m7,You can but these information you must search for and actually find yourself because they wont let it go viral because US soldiers being there is a big deal the OP put the link for it stop letting your lack of faith as your front to down people whose only encouragement for fighting back is faith wether you believe it in or not their faith is their only weapon right now so encourage it dont down it.
k6zi2ih,That‚Äôll get the world to be on your side
k6zi1r4,Just like the Nazis were hunted down for years after the holocaust. The same is for Israelis. They will be the bad guy on earth for the next 100 years.
k6zi1r1,"You can check the IDF Telegram channel on October 27th, they posted a picture displaying all the eliminations that have been carried out."
k6zi0t0,"It's gross to justify the bombing of toddlers, do better"
k6zhzz7,"Not really no. Given the fact they've spent the last 10 or so years supporting settlers, and all the abuse they do, as well as annexing territory in the west bank. They also donate to Hamas to ensure that a Palestinian state never happens.

They spent the last 2 years trying to rip up Israeli democracy.

Hamas is a political party as well. Both use state power  to terrorize their victims."
k6zhzq5,"Israel literally committed the NAKBA. Israel has cornered the native dispossessed Palestinians into ghettos, enclaves, and concentration camps. Israel has set up a occupation and apartheid system. Israel indiscriminately bombs civilians to maintain a grip on power."
k6zhz9m,The Palestinian death toll seems exceedingly low after watching all these clips.
k6zhy45,"Then why do many support the occupation, illegal settlements, and decades-long siege of Gaza? According to many international organizations Israel is an apartheid state."
k6zhy4d,"And you make my point beautifully too. ""Hamas spreads propaganda"". You know when you drop a building on civilians, half of which are women and children, it's not propaganda. It's just the truth. No bias, no skewed narrative. When you see electricity, food, water, aid cut for 2.2 million people. It's not propaganda. Palestinians don't NEED bias and propaganda. They just need to show the genocide that's taking place in their land. But the media won't even allow that to happen. You know what we had to see after Oct 7th ""700 Israelis killed in terror attack. 1000+ Palestinians have died"". It's disgusting. The media has always dehumanised the Palestinians using language. 

The palestinans are just cannon fodder for Israelis and the media don't care. You sit here crying about bias, so infuriating when your side has all the resources. I love how you don't even acknowledge that the idf had to redact the comment about the beheaded babies after they were caught lying. Of course children died in the hamas attacks. That itself is tragic. But what message does it give the world when you say babies were behaded? And for the record, NONE of them were beheaded and if you claim they were, show me a legitimate source. I will say it again. Israel doesn't suffer in comparison to palestine!! Every single person that was caught in the attack on 7th October is getting state of the art medical care. The thousands of children with limbs blown off in palestine don't even have medicine to help reduce the pain."
k6zhxw0,"Oh no, there goes a major base of support!"
k6zhxca,"They can have access. They only need to ask their government. Israel giving Gaza even more stockpiles means it helps Hamas survive.

Hamas will have to eventually give their people supplies if they don't want a rebellion or those people fleeing the strip.

&amp;#x200B;

Exactly which is why Israel is justified in invading."
k6zhw8j,It doesn‚Äôt suffer from over drafting. It suffers from the Palestinians polluting the water. Still most of their water comes from that aquifer and from desalinization plants.
k6zhw3z,"Getting unbiased information from one of the parts of the conflict, will be tough, not to say impossible. As impossible as to see an objective by someone involved..."
k6zhvi5,"Proportionality is a fascinating concept because it does not actually provide concrete guidelines, and every attack is case-specific. Found this article ruminating on proportionality in Israel/Palestine very helpful in thinking about the concept: https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/israeli-targeting-procedures-and-concept-proportionality
The article discusses the Israeli military‚Äôs civilian-to-militant kill ratio and asks (leaving the answer open ended) where the line is between an acceptable and unacceptable civilian-to-militant kill ratio. It‚Äôs such a tough question to answer, but curious to hear if others have opinions on where that line is."
k6zhv56,It‚Äôs an argument many have used in here. Hard to defend your point because all I hear is ‚Äúwell if they can do it why can‚Äôt we‚Äù. Are you suggesting that genocide is ok because you believe other countries do it too?
k6zhuup,"&gt;Cherry-Picking

The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been quite a low level, low casualty conflict. Although sadly not in the last few weeks. The conflict attracts a disproportionate amount of sending. What middle east / Muslim / Arab conflict attracts as much attention as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict does?"
k6zhuqx,real human bean
k6zhuh7,In this conflict the UN opinion is not relevant. The Arabs established that when they rejected the partition in 1947. They can‚Äôt have it both ways.
k6zhud7,Because nothing shouts ‚Äúwe want peace‚Äù like stealing other people‚Äôs property.
k6zhtxn,"The only statements I've seen is ""they arn't coming back"" as they tear down the posters in NYC.  There was originally a movement among local jews to post hostage posters with the pictures of missing people.  

You can easily google this to find a source of your liking.

Here is one example from where some teenage girls were recording themselves walking down the street tearing down the hostage posters."
k6zhtpy,"&gt;But these goat fuckers Hamas need to release the hostages ~~that aren‚Äôt even from Israel~~

FTFY"
k6zhtmx,The cowards are the ones dropping bombs on innocent people in Gaza.
k6zht99,At least one of the freed hostages said they were being held in those tunnels.
k6zhta8,Wonder why? If it were 1000 terrorists that would be absurd. I guess it was 1000 innocent people.
k6zhszz,Well said.
k6zhrtn,He didn't defend Hamas. He defended the sick people who couldn't evacuate. And then you accused him of not being mad at Hamas. It's more than possible to be mad at both forces here. Are we really at a point where we HAVE to preface EVERYTHING we say with fuck Hamas before people such as yourself blame people for supporting Hamas? This accusation game is bullshit.
k6zhrhe,"Yes they helped you, without them, you wouldn‚Äôt be where you are. The 1939 White paper was for the Arabs. They gave you Balfour to tell you have a right to be in Palestine and the white paper was to make the Arabs happy but it didn‚Äôt work, cause why the fuck would I want to split my home 50/50 with you? 

You keep saying you guys had no intention of going to war but history shows you were always the first aggressors. 

And do they have everything to prosper? Is that what netenyahu and the IDF are telling you? Did you know Israel is one of the most heavily restricted and censored countries? It makes sense why none of you know proper history and there‚Äôs always a little twist to it."
k6zhr9q,"Israel took money given to them by Germany as repetitions for the victims of the holocaust instead of it going to the victims and fails to give them proper medical treatment. About 1 survivor dies every day and had been even before they were all as old as they are now.

Zionists viewed these victims as weak."
k6zhqwv,"Ok, where are you from?"
k6zhqar,"The problem is he didn't say anything, he just showed some data about war crimes Isreal is supported and most countries in the West supported them. How do you know if he is Muslim? And the only place it's hated in is Europe and America. And please how did he promot Extremism? And do you even know what Jihad means?"
k6zhpl6,being a black israeli is not the same as being a black hebrew israelite
k6zhplb,Oh I think they meant r/israelcrimes
k6zhphf,"Quicker more accurate news: ghosts from Allah. 
And if there are American marines, that‚Äôs huge. If they were captured that info would be out in the world."
k6zhpa8,They are also one of the most ancient civilization. They lived without this fanatism for 2600 years while embracing different form of religion or institutions. Persian people are great human contributors since Cyrus the Great days.
k6zhojv,Their bodies are most likely unrecognizable now
k6zhogj,"Yeah Bibi is facing corruption charges, he doesn‚Äôt have massive support from the public.

He recently passed a law to prevent acting leaders from facing criminal charges.

His goal is to stir up enough hate in the Israeli public. That way, it doesn‚Äôt matter if he lacks support. Because as long as he keeps the war going he can stay in power."
k6zhn7e,This is terrifying.
k6zhn5i,Israelis*
k6zhmze,"Do you honestly believe [these people](https://twitter.com/khaberni/status/1717543763076173933) don't brutalize Palestinians in captivity? They're doing it psychologically right there, displaying enormous insensitivity and cruelty"
k6zhmtu,"Israel has behaved incredibly nobly in the past three weeks, so I think we should keep trading with Israel. Also, if you did try to embargo Israel, Israel would have far more motivation to launch a much larger invasion of Gaza."
k6zhmj7,"Then, you seem to be more Israeli than the Israelis themselves, lol. Even Jews around the world have been condemning Israel for the ongoing massacre, saying they should stop killing innocent people in our name. I don't know what kind of person you are, praising for killing more and more innocent people, but hopefully, you will seek treatment and strive for peace. Israel, without the support of the USA, can't do anything, and the whole world knows it."
k6zhmhe,"There are a wide variety of reasons this conflict gets more attention. Israel is by far the most powerful country in the region and is allied to most redditors home countries. It‚Äôs a lot easier for media to cover conflict in Israel than in Syria or Yemen. I don‚Äôt think this is hard to understand. 

To counter your point. I would like you to think about this. Why don‚Äôt the refugees in Ukraine go live in Poland. They‚Äôre both Slavic. They‚Äôre both Christian. Why is Russian annexation such a big deal? Sounds kinda nonsensical right? 

To answer your question at its inception, Israel faced a major demographic problem. The Jewish population was outnumbered by Arab inhabitants in the region. Encouraging Jewish immigration was seen as a means to increase the Jewish population and establish a more secure foundation for the new state or outnumber the Arabs depending on how you would like to frame it. 

To just blame everything on the Arab worlds antisemitism and not the material conditions that lead to antisemitism is foolish and helps no one. Except the Israeli government I suppose."
k6zhm6m,"I don‚Äôt know about you bro, I talk about it all the time. I also talk about the murdered israeli arabs, and the beduins, and the children, and the women, and everyone else. That‚Äôs such a horrible attack."
k6zhm3u,There was no country as ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù in 1948. It was the British Mandate and the Ottoman Empire before that.
k6zhlnp,How did he survive?
k6zhlnw,"I get job creation  helps stimulate that economic sector... but i see that as an expense not a source of revenue.
I only see #4,5 and maybe 7 as actual income streams for the US.

Like if you're involved in a war and win, how does a country profit.... vs if you lose a war those efforts must just be losses right? Or what don't I understand"
k6zhlmj,"That‚Äôs the IDF logic though. According to the definition of a human shield (by Israel) every man woman and child in Gaza is one. So literally anyone near Hamas offices, missile sites, Hamas persons, is a human shield. So any civilian infrastructure is quite literally considered ‚ÄòHamas‚Äô. That‚Äôs their excuse to bomb the living daylights out of them. 
Please stop falling for propaganda."
k6zhk6a,"give me the link to those graphic ones - I have allready asked and got a lot of BS links to videos that are either old videos from somewhere else and pro israelis claim that they are hamas attack, videos or they show nothing what is claimed to be

I can handle gore videos I am following wars for years now - I have seen ISIS videos I have seen cartel mexico videos etc

 - but no - its always some BS links to some BS fake sires or PDF documents with a lot of BS text claiming it to be something it is not

gaslighting basically

&gt; I showed you body cams, you know they killed civilians (paraded Shani Louk around and spit on her).

she ended up in Gaza hospital - how do you know that Israelis did not shot her and Hamas just took her back to hospital and to hold her as hostage

so they can later exchange her for Palestinian hostages that Israel keeps in prisons (?)"
k6zhjiz,Israel doesn't provide the construction materials. When Israel lifted the blockade on construction materials they allowed the metal pipes in which were then repurposed into rockets. If Israel blocked the water pipes they would no doubt have been blasted in the international community.
k6zhj0t,Human shields have not been confirmed by anyone‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs propaganda so far as there is no evidence
k6zhiwi,It appears to be banned
k6zhivf,You don‚Äôt think Israel governs Palestine? Do you think Palestine has autonomy or something?
k6zhiis,It doesn‚Äôt. The vast majority of water in Gaza comes from an aquifer in Gaza. Only about 10 percent of their water comes from Israel.
k6zhi8u,1/5 of Israelis are Palestinian/Arab what are you talking about
k6zhi5d,Maybe park it in Arabian sea instead.
k6zhhuu,Lol exactly
k6zhhjt,Good thing that‚Äôs not whats happening. It‚Äôs the IDF striking military targets(Hamas) with human shields in front of them. Which is a war crime on Hamas‚Äô part.
k6zhh1k,"I actually didn‚Äôt call anyone stupid, I called him an idiot.

I didn‚Äôt protest me being banned for saying that, I called out the blatant double standard of pro Israeli‚Äôs not being banned for FAR more inflammatory comments. Which you seem to ignore.

Calling someone a bigot is not a ‚Äúpersonal attack.‚Äù If it is then every single pro Israeli person in this sub should be banned for calling everyone and their mother who doesn‚Äôt bend over for them ‚Äúantisemitic.‚Äù

k6zheoq,"Israel isn‚Äôt deliberately causing harm to civilians. They are going after specific targets. Civilians die in every war, that doesn‚Äôt make it some violation of international law (which doesn‚Äôt matter at all for any nation compared to their sovereign rights to protect themselves) nor rules of war. 

Everything Israel is doing they have the right to do, and the obligation to do to protect their people."
k6zheje,"Over half of the Jews in Israel are from the Middle East and Africa, NOT Europe, and a lot were kicked out of their countries.

k6zh7fy,Your stupid.
k6zh7d7,"Nope, the nicer Israel is to Hamas and its supporters, the worse Hamas and its supporters in Gaza are to Israel. This is because Hamas and its supporters believe that Israeli kindness is only a sign of weakness to be exploited. Hamas' mission has nothing to do with trying to improve the quality of life for Gazans in any way, especially because Hamas' leadership runs Gaza from abroad in luxury homes in places like London and Qatar. Hamas' mission is the extermination of the Jews. Hamas is attacking Jews all over the world in places like London, and Hamas is even lobbying governments around the world such as Portugal around the world to deny citizenship to Jews from Israel because it wants to keep Jews in Israel to exterminate them. If Hamas simply wanted to destroy Israel but not exterminate the Jews that Hamas would encourage other countries to take in Jews from Israel without attacking them. Since it did not but rather encourages attacks on Jews worldwide, it is abundantly clear that it is trying to exterminate the Jews.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So the support for Hamas in Gaza has nothing to do with every single  living soul in that hellhole have multiple family members murdered by  the IDF?

Nope. The IDF has only killed in self-defense. Sometimes, it kills civilians by accident and collateral damage, but risks have to be taken to protect oneself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The only way to wipe out Hamas, permanently, is to remove the conditions of existence for Hamas, which is the occupation.

Hamas is operating in London and getting subsidies from the British government.

The nicer one is to Hamas and its billions of sympathizers, the worse they are to Israel."

They also killed many Arab and Bedouin people (with many sacrificing their own life to save people), in previous years they had many people sympathise more with the Palestinians rather than Israel with the peak of 2021 that had riots in the streets during the war with Gaza.

Now? nothing, and more than that, the Arab, Bedoin and Jews got closer together against Hamas."

Hamas is not an ethnicity, Arabs are, and the IDF's and the Israeli public's apparent repugnance for protecting Arab lives from such massive and indiscriminate bombardment amounts to ethnic cleansing even if the stated target is Hamas."
k6zgjm5,"1. What do you know about the Balfour declaration? It was a document that was signed by british government that claimed they will help us establish a national home for the jewish people. This was absolutely not a biding contract, and in fact a couple of years later they withdrew from it with the publicity of the 1939 white book. In it, they limited the number of jewish immigrants and jews couldn't buy lands in israel. About the partition plan, this is historically wrong. Almost all israelis liked it and accepted it. Many danced around in the streets, and we had no intention to go to war.

2. They have brought everything onto theirselves. They have everything they need to prosper and live a good life, but it's their leader's view of the world to only destroy Israel that's limiting their progress. And yes I know the history of the holocaust. Don't dare to say anything about that, my great grandparents' family were murdered by the nazis.

‚ÄúThe day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect, he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself, he becomes wise.‚Äù"
k6zfpa7,This is nothing need to be alarmed
k6zfojy,You know how your solution is going to make more violance?
k6zfnxg,You do realise that every side is claiming those exact allegations on another every single one you mentioned. What I'm wondering what do you and specifically you have which makes you so aggressive against Israel
k6zfnsd,Even Russia and China?
k6zfntl,"So you're saying this is your... Final Solution? 

The sickest irony of all history is that a people ghettoized and ethnically cleansed turn around and do it to another people, and expect the world to watch in anything but absolute horror."
k6zfn41,They would have a seperate state by now if Hamas and its ilk like the PIJ hadnt shot 20000 rockets into Isreal since they pulled out of Gaza.
k6zfmw0,"If you have fire superiority it‚Äôs your responsibility to use it responsibly. ‚ÄúThe enemy is hiding in the hospital‚Äù is a morally bankrupt excuse for bombing a literal hospital containing civilians. I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight. As an outside observer I only see these actions guaranteeing another generation of war driven by hatred. You can‚Äôt bomb your way to peace, you can only bomb your enemy into submission. Missiles dont remove the hate or motivation to harm."
k6zfmh3,"In that case, you should be advocating for cutting the US trade from the world as well for their actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. You won‚Äôt do that, though."

Very selfless. And then they‚Äôre caught up in this when all they really want to do is send their niece to school. 

Feels like Hamas could score mega PR points among some folks by releasing them."
k6zfkxv,"So people in Dagestan are somehow worried that a single Israeli plane is going to take over their whole country? The Israelis are powerful, but not that powerful."
k6zfkts,Source? Over 1000 Hamas terrorists were killed in Israel on the first day alone
k6zfkv1,"Yes, especially we muslims are angry at what the Israeli zionist government is doing. But not all Jewish civilians are okay with what Netanyahu is doing. Why ""hunt"" them down?"
k6zfjvl,lol do you think they're immigrating to Dagestan? they're either there for business or tourism
k6zfjry,"&gt;The same crap was said to the Americans while fighting the British about using Guerilla warfare and not stand in rows ‚Äúlike you‚Äôre supposed to‚Äù.

I agree with the main point, but...

On an open field, the Continental Army and Patriot militias generally fought using conventional tactics.

Meanwhile, British soldiers and Loyalist militias were able to fight in open order formation if the terrain necessitated it, being trained to do so after the disastrous Braddock Expedition during the French and Indian War."
k6zfjl7,Yep. They dont really care about palestinians and are a extream minority
k6zfjed,"$$$ rules the world. Arab and Muslim leaders are slaves to the $. Just like all the ""free"" Western countries."

k6zfixo,"When black slaves killed their white masters in the US, was that genocide?"
k6zfhx6,because its the only way to combat an organization that operates in underground tunnels?
k6zfh9y,https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/ doesn‚Äôt look like this at all.

\- Yeah, but it didn't change nothing..."
k6zfg5l,You realize those numbers come from a government run by Hamas?
k6zffv1,Im petty sure almost all jews do not support apartheid
k6zffk3,In some cultures the killing of Jews is seen as a *good* thing
k6zfenk,"there were Jews living in Palestine, as well as Muslims and Christians before 1948. Until Zionists decided to have a country only for Jews. And they committed countless crimes since then. Stop misinterpreting the Quran to feed your propaganda mindset. Give me the verse that you‚Äôre talking about and i‚Äôll tell what it really means"
k6zfepr,Pretty sure they will just wait a bit longer into the ground invasion and say Israel killed them.
k6zfejp,"Israel has defended itself from countless Palestinian attacks from Gaza and the West Bank. The current operation in Gaza is legitimate self-defense, and Israel is not intentionally targeting civilians. Hamas wants civilians to die as their human shields.

Thankfully it will eventually be over. Israel has already said that once Hamas is eliminated and the hostages released, the war will end immediately."
k6zfemy,"&gt;Absolutely these cowards should be sent a clear message from all middle eastern countries that they're not welcome here.


That message was sent in 1948, 1951-3, 1967, 1973 and 2000


&gt;Their presense in our region is a cancer. They are a destabilizing force that have caused no end of suffering all over the middle east for decades, and while their people are killing our women and children, we do not want to see them at our doorsteps.


And I'm sure a lot of them say the same about you and yours. It's what people use to justify all of this 


&gt;What is happening in that video should have been the case in every airport, port, train station all over the Muslim world. We do not want genocidal zionazis here anymore.


Ah yes harassing Jews all over the world to show the Zionists you don't have a problem with Jews, just the state of Israel"
k6zfe34,Hamas even claims to use hostages as human shields. Anyone who thinks they aren‚Äôt embedded in civilian infrastructure has an agenda.
k6zfdkl,"Take a deep breath. I'm interested in your answer to my question. Rephrased: If you were Bibi, would you trade ""everyone for everyone"" or not?"
k6zfd88,"I did not say Arabs getting kicked out wasn‚Äôt wrong, you already had that on your list but you had left out any reference to Jews also having a historic presence in the land.

Israel has indeed violated many agreements and UN resolutions.  But you seem to be pushing a narrative that Israel breaks the rules while Arab parties follow the rules and want peace.  

The Arab coalition invaded in 1948, 1967 and 1973.  Those are also violations of agreements.  The intifadas are violations of agreements.  And there are many other examples."
k6zfd8a,You called someone an idiot and called someone else a bigot and stupid. Both being blatant rule 1 violations.
k6zfchh,"Probably just a bunch of those ""pro-Palestinian"" people, who are definitely not antisemites.. ü§î"
k6zfc4x,"No one said their religion, don't make up a story"
k6zfa89,"no he lifted his leg up , that‚Äôs intentional"
k6zfa4d,"Hamas is using the people of Gaza as human shields. You saw how much they care for innocent life on Oct 7. 

The deadliest hospital blast was also from a hamas rocket that misfired. Its surprising how many fewer people would die if Hamas could see an option other than Jihad. 

Pray for a quick end to them. Its the only way to limit Palestinian suffering in general. Hamas knew all these people would die as a direct result of their actions. They were banking on it to generate more hatred of Isreal."
k6zf9mk,Big deal
k6zf9e5,"yeah but they are on ice ... have you never seen what the human body will do automatically and instinctively to correct balancing? reflexes are uncontrollable when they arent expected.

to be honest its a risk they take getting on an ice rink with other men with blades on their feet.. its more likely to be an accident than well placed kick at those speeds too."
k6zf95l,"Don't pretend this sub is any better... The two coexist in completely opposite realities. One being largely pro-Israel propaganda, the other being largely pro-Palestine propaganda."
k6zf92v,"All the protests, discussions, riots, etc. has to be giving Hamas a sense of victory (which sucks) but even they must be going ‚Äòwait wtf?‚Äô at this."
k6zf8yo,"Sure, I'm in."
k6zf8o3,"The sad reality is that hamas is a cancer growing inside and outside of the palestinain population. it is made up of palestinians who have been radicalized and brainwashed into violence and martyrdom. 

There is no fighting it without some harm to the host, and that harm in this case is real human tragedy for innocent gazans. 

But what else can you do but to remove and fight the cancer anyways. Living with it isn't an option."
k6zf83v,"Fuck around, find out!"
k6zf7tg,"The thing that really gets me is all the supporters trying to compare this shit to WW2 and the Holocaust.

I know there's not a ton of them but every time I see it I feel like I lose brain cells.

In the last month or two I've rewatched Band of Brothers, which thanks to Steven's incredible directing and passion for the topic, drove me down the rabbit hole. YT breakdowns of the Siege of Bastogne, etc.

They better hope this shit NEVER becomes like what Europe saw.

The parallels I've seen drawn to the holocaust are really, really disgusting and downplays how vile it was."
k6zf7si,you think Hamas is worried about that? more missiles and bombs and dead civilians sense to work pretty damn well for their propaganda.
k6zf7am,"Because a Pissraeli plane landed there, it has absolutely no business being there. Pissraelis have no right to enter any Muslim lands because every time a Pissraeli has entered Muslim lands, it has ended in the death, disspossession and destruction of Muslim lives."
k6zf6xb,well even the idf said it only killed 70 of hamas members
k6zf644,"Terrorist attack occurs in New York, resulting in the brutal deaths of thousands of American civilians. US goes to war in the Middle East. 

Invasion occurs in eastern Ukraine, resulting in the brutal deaths of thousands of allied civilians. US sends weapons galore to Ukraine. 

Terrorist attack occurs in Isreal, resulting in the brutal deaths of thousands of allied civilians. Hmmm, I wonder what the US will do?"
k6zf64t,True. have you seen what happened to moroccans in morocco? they're getting evicted by israelis after their country recognized israel
k6zf5ns,"It‚Äôs fascinating to witness. For some, it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt give a toss about the atrocities committed by Hamas or have already forgotten. For many, they sit comfortably at home virtue signalling and living in fantasy land. The double standard is astonishing. Basically, Israel should do nothing, sit on their asses and let Hamas prosper. Gaza spouts casualty numbers and you see so many lapping it up without considering for a second that this is a Hamas government run who benefits from the impossible situation Israel finds itself in. Every innocent Palestinian death serves their cause and feeds the ridiculous genocide narrative. Hamas is responsible for everything that happens in Gaza. Israel does their best to limit civilian casualties but they cannot be avoided.

Why can‚Äôt these idiots understand that? It‚Äôs not saying civilian deaths are okay, it‚Äôs a function of war here. Hamas needs to be wiped out and unfortunately, many Palestinians will suffer because of that, and it is what it is.

Hamas could stop this right now, release the hostages, surrender, lay down their weapons, face prosecution for their crimes, but let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs never happening."
k6zf5jq,"""officials"" Fuck outta here. Hamas said it, which is guaranteed to be a lie.."
k6zf5jj,An idiotic take from a misinformed person. There is no genocide and israel isnt responsible for people in gaza electing hamas. Why should they add 2 million residents who activally hate the country. Think critically for a moment. So they commit a modern day porgrim and we need to give them citizenship and free reigh to go about the country? No way. Feel free to take them to your own country though. In an ideal solution they will be goverened by a unity goverment of some saudi nations un and a westren nation. To improve their quality of life. If israel does this idiots like you will scream colonization! and genocide! like you numnuts usually do.
k6zf4j7,That‚Äôs the kind of thing militaries plan out before an attack. You can‚Äôt get upset when the aggressor gets their teeth kicked in.
k6zf3hb,"Mm not really, but your response is kind of a whataboutism"
k6zf28n,"Lets see. Oslo, barak offer, withdraw from gaza, want more? I can continue"
k6zf1xr,"If they‚Äôre dead it‚Äôs extremely likely they‚Äôll just blame Israel, as they have been already for everything"
k6zf1t4,"They are pro Palestinian but refuse to give any solution to Hamas. That‚Äôs just asking Israel to roll over and let Hamas slaughter Israeli citizens.

Let‚Äôs put it to the test. The events of 7/10 just happened, you are Israel, what do you do now?"
k6zf0v1,the new left wing are open ISIS supporters i see
k6zf0iw,This is an interesting take. Can you share where you currently reside - Iran or elsewhere? I am genuinely curious.
k6zf0i5,"I think the media in Western Europe isn‚Äôt fully representing what people think. Pro Palestinian marches in Ireland and UK are far far far larger than any pro Israeli matches there have been in these countries. But the government and media spin a very pro Israeli attitude which isn‚Äôt accurate for the general population. 

Over 100,000 people were at a pro Palestinian March in London yesterday, but the government would nearly make you believe it was actually a pro Israeli march based on the governments narrative.

The difference between the governments opinion and the populations opinion on Israel vs Palestine are quite different."
k6zez8l,Oh I will
k6zey4e,"But my question is, why Dagestan? Israel doesn't steal land, but if Iran, Syria or any of the other Arab countries try to interfere with Israel's defensive operation in Gaza, Israel would be at war with them.

But I don't understand the connection to Dagestan. It's more than 1,500 miles away from Israel, doesn't look like it has much of a military, and doesn't look like it's ever been in conflict with Israel. Why would the two countries have anything to do with each other?"
k6zexvx,"&gt;Sadly?

My man thinks there are no civilians in Israel. Wait for him to claim I'm the racist somehow though


&gt;As a matter of fact, it's how Pissraelis universally think about Palestinians.

I know you need to tell yourself that to justify your hatred I understand"
k6zex03,The funniest part is how Israel treats their black community‚Ä¶..
k6zewev,"They left 2,000 (not 3,000) years ago, and I don't think anyone claims they're the same genetically. Rather that they are related."
k6zevv0,"From Muslim community yeah, rarely."
k6zev4l,Exactly the opposite happened
k6zetnx,Dagestan is truly amazing! And they know the danger of even letting a single Israeli enter. The Palestinian experience has taught a lesson to all Muslims about these people. Let one enter and soon they'll say your land belonged to them 3000 years ago and the Americans/Europeans will back them.
k6zetog,"I thought of responding point by point, but... it wouldnt matter. You believe whom you believe and anything on the contrary is a lie. Okay. So Im left with a question - what did Hamas do that has inspired so much trust? What is it that makes you believe they would never lie to you, that they've never lied to you?"
k6zetbs,"I fully support Israel here, I don't think that Egypt should be forced to take them. 

Egypt barely escaped from muslim brotherhood rule and they are trying to build a secular state. Soon, they will have elections. If the brotherhood gets back in power, most of Egyptians will be fucked. 

Historically, Palestinian refugees brought only troubles to the countries that accepted them. See Jordan and Lebanon ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September) )

I think that their supporters, Qatar, Iran, Turkey, SA, should take them. They have the means to provide. Also, leaders of Hamas are billionaires (from the EU money) living in Qatar, they should provide for the refugees."
k6zesqi,Hamas is really fighting against the interests of their civilians by starting wars they cannot win
k6zes73,Almost every electronic devise has went through some proces in israel.
k6zert2,"Israel is in the wrong for how they oppressed and killed  innocent Palestinians for 75 years, nobody talks about that. Now they are fighting back against their oppressors, while I don‚Äôt condemn Hamas, Israel is nowhere near the right here. The War crimes they commit daily and the children they kill by dropping bombs on them. No electricity, water or internet it‚Äôs sad to see. Israel is not responding appropriately, as they even drop bombs on  other countries that aren‚Äôt even involved in this war. They even bomb  the West Bank."
k6zerlh,"What a peaceful, respectable group of nothing but men. I‚Äôm sure they only wish for peace and love."

I‚Äôm all for rules of war, I also understand terrorism and guerrilla warfare change the rules. If we stuck with the humanitarian rules of combat America would have lost to Britain in the firing lines of open fields."
k6zer5x,"Actually, if you don't like what I said, it doesn't make me embarrassed, but it might make you feel embarrassed because your Israeli patriotism has blinded you to the suffering of innocent civilians. I don't have to read because i can distinguish between committing a genocide and defending itself. We all know what Israel is capable of, but it can't do more than it's doing now because its allies (the US) can no longer provide the same level of cover."

k6zenci,"Answering the question with another question is the appropriate response, since the question of 'Do you support Hamas' is designed to deflect attention away from the actual issue.

k6zem10,"I feel bad for the Palestinian children.

But these goat fuckers Hamas need to release the hostages that aren‚Äôt even from Israel"
k6zelmo,Lol
k6zeknq,"Technically Palestine didn‚Äôt go to war with Israel ever.  That is what gets a little dicey in understanding the history.
Basically during the Ottoman Empire and the British Palestinian Mandate people of various ethnicities LIVED in that area (I am going to call it ‚ÄúThe Holy Land‚Äù just to make it easier to follow but that would include everything from Med Sea to Jordan River). When Israel proclaimed its national existence, they didn‚Äôt make any plans for what to do with the people who lived there that didn‚Äôt meet their citizenship criteria (who we refer to as Palestinians). Basically everyone who was left out got backing from Arab countries to start a civil war.

NO one ever made plans for the population that lived there. If they had we wouldn‚Äôt be in this current mess."
k6zejze,Tbf I don't think Hamas is the smartest group of folks.
k6zejl9,"More like:  
A two state solution as outlined  by the 1948 UN Partition Plan for Palestine was a fair acceptable outcome. Jews accepted it. Arabs refused to accept it.

Arabs subsequently attacked Israel and lost."

k6zegsc,"Lol, are you really saying the global financial weight of Israel and Israeli propaganda is less than that of the global financial weight of ... Palestinians? You really think there's a world-wide Arab conspiracy to reply on reddit, when we have evidence everywhere that pro-Palestinian writers and figures are being cancelled left and right by secret emails to administrators?

Keep your eyes closed, I'll tell you when it's safe to see reality again."
k6zeg6e,"Hamas has stockpiled food medicine and fuel for years. Gazans should check the basement for those supplies.  
Water has been resupplied by Israel as it used to, after Biden pressured.  


And I wasn't talking about that. I was asking you to provide an option that helps disarm Gaza."
k6zefx9,This has been public info since 2014 that the military base is stationed there.
k6zefci,"‚ÄúCheck history facts‚Äù

No, the violence was started in 1947 by the Arabs. Moreover the conflict predates that, most people put the start at 1920 in anti semitic riots. 

Claiming ‚Äúbut this conflict is longer than October 7th‚Äù is true, but it also completely ignores what kind of organization Hamas is. It doesn‚Äôt matter what Israel did, there could be a 2SS, peace no blockade etc. and Hamas would still do something like this. Hamas doesn‚Äôt want peace, back in the 90‚Äôs when it looked like peace was on the horizon, Hamas sent suicide bombers to try to derail the peace process. When Israel disengaged from Gaza and ended its occupation, Hamas attacked its fellow Palestinian militants and took over, then fired missiles into Israel, which started the blockade after. 

This isn‚Äôt another mere episode of violence, this was an intentional massacre by Hamas, that it sought to use to make Israel kill lore Gazans as well, all to destroy any prospect of peace. Hamas at every turn has tried to derail and end peace talks, this isn‚Äôt normal nor Israel‚Äôs fault, this is all Hamas fault."
k6zefe7,"We did. In Afghanistan. And in Iraq.

k6zef7r,"And now you sound like a five-year-old saying ""I know you are but what am I""."

k6zeeuq,"Israel is simultaneously warning the Red Crescent to evacuate the Quds Hopsital and maintaining a bombardment of all routes of egress.

Not only are the doctors and patients hemmed in by the bombardment they will be forced to brave to avoid destruction, but there are fourteen thousand women and children and elderly using the hospital as a point of refuge.

And it needs remembering, as I've seen more than a few comments forgetting this, that there is plenty of dissent within Israel itself that is being heavily repressed at this moment and has been for many long years.

Israel, as much as it is an antiplaestinian colonial state, is  increasingly an omplicitly antisemitic state.

It hates Jews that dare disagree with its ethnic cleansing of Palestine, even as it posits itself and the protector of Jews worldwide.

Don't let the actions of this shit-awful country make you in to something as bad as their fascist government and settlers are."

Almost all of the Arab world is cheering or atleast turning **a blind eye to HAMAS**, every single college, or liberal organization in the US has condoned HAMAS and their ""mission.""

You're wording is really interesting (I bolded the specific part), because it is so similar to what [Erdoƒüan had said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of5cEm6sFHM), the West will 'shed tears for Israeli losses, but turn a blind eye to the deaths and destruction of Palestinians, Gaza'

After the 1948 genocide and war, British pulled out cause they were exhausted from WW2 and the Israel conflict, and decided to hand it to the UN to deal with it. That‚Äôs the transfer your talking about. Of course you left out everything before it.
Also, no the Israelis do not want a 2 state solution. If you did you wouldn‚Äôt have killed Rabin and elected Netenyahu. Oslo Accord. Google that too. This is your history you should know this already if your from Israel.

2) You gave them electricity and water for peace? You throw them in a concentration camp and give them water for peace? Do you know the history of the holocaust? You‚Äôve been oppressing them for 75 years as your general population cheers on. 

3) Not an open air prison but legit the whole world recognizes it as such.

Second,there are a lot of illegal palestinian buildings too,if you want to destroy the settlements(when it happend to the palestinian,they called it the nakba and complained about it for 75 years) you'll probably need to destroy the palestinian settlement too.

To further my point, you could ask why other Arab nations didn't immediately absorb all the  Palestinians in 1948, similar to how Israel absorbed the Arab world's Jewish population.

And Russia used that to its advantage, sending just enough to hold while surmounting the biggest pincer maneuver ever seen, that resulted in disaster for Germany.


They weren't just dug in holding to their death based on some ideological beliefs like japan were doing.


So iwo jima Definitely sounds more similar.

This is Zionist projection. Israel has no plan for Gaza except to go in there and 'kill Hamas' and lord knows anyone else they find, ie kill Muslims. It's openly declared ethnic cleansing justified by references to an antisemitic charter document.

Regarding what happened exactly, it changes depending on who you ask. But there is no doubt Israel inflates and exaggerated what happened. They post staged photos and don‚Äôt separate civilian and combatant deaths from the total death toll. They opened fire on hostages while they were still in Israel because they prioritize killing Hamas over not hitting their people. They also refused 2 hostages initially for who knows why. Additionally, air strikes have killed 25 journalists, so there is a question as to if they actually use precision air strikes at all, or if they use them to precisely target journalists as they looked into shutting Al Jazeera down. 

Regarding what Hamas did, there is proof of someone trying to behead someone with a shovel, they put a woman on a truck and spat on her, and took many hostages including children. And of course they opened fire on civilians. Some accounts of bodies burnt to a crisp. 

This is from what I have seen."

k6zbpcz,Welcome to Reddit.
k6zbolg,"Israel has been isolating Gaza, yes. They did so after they completely pulled out in 2005. But why would Israel do such a thing? Even if you do not agree with the isolation, you have to examine the reasons that it was put in place. Hamas sent suicide bombers and shooters into Jewish communities and blew up cafes, malls, movie theaters, they blew up a US diplomatic convoy. Israel pulled out and built a wall and said fuck that. Meanwhile much of the aid provided to Gaza since then was stolen by Hamas and used to build tunnels, rockets, and other military infrastructure. After disengaging from Gaza, should they have been required to allow terrorists to continue into their country and slaughter their civilians? Should Israel not bomb Hamas when they shoot rockets into Israeli cities?

And sure, we also should examine why Hamas does what they do. This is a vicious cycle because both sides run on fear and their leaders use this fear for control. This is why the issue is so complex. If Israel stops isolating Gaza, what do you do about the terrorists? And if Hamas stops attacking Israel, or accepts Israel as a nation? Should Hamas stop fighting for a ""free Palestine"" or whatever they say they stand for aside from jihad? Palestinians and many Arabs would not accept this, Hamas will lose their power, and then someone will likely fill the void. This is the Palestinian problem. Any decision that will lead them to peace will not be widely accepted, and those at the top lose their power. And they will continue to attack Israel, and Israel will continue to retaliate harder than they are hit. If they do not, their other neighbors will see that as weakness. These are the rules, no nation in the Middle East can show weakness. Arafat knew this, Issam Sartawi and King Abdullah learned this the hard way, and many other people in power knew or learned this as well."

Since I was 10, up until a few years ago, I was reading and educating myself a lot about WW2 and about the Holocaust. So I have a lot of empathy for anyone who suffered in the concentration camps. I‚Äôve been to one, they‚Äôre haunting- they‚Äôre awful. So, of course at first I was like ‚ÄúIsrael has a right to defend themselves and do what they need to do to protect themselves‚Äù, but then I started learning a bit about Palestine because I thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs two sides to this‚Äù and I started to gain an appreciation and empathy for Palestine. 
I, right now, am still so confused about who is who and why they are doing what they are doing. 
My instant thought was ‚ÄúWhat is Israel doing? Why are they doing this to Palestine. This is awful‚Äù and I was getting upset that so many people were siding with Israel without question. 
Then you have the video footage of Hamas kidnapping people and reports of people being brutality murdered by Hamas. So then I get confused about who Hamas is, and why they are doing this‚Ä¶ like how I understand it is that Israel has been slowly taking over Palestinian territory over the years? Which is awful. Idk how they could do this. 
So, Hamas is the gov‚Äôt party in power, and they‚Äôre voted in? If they are why would people vote for them? Are they being forced? Are they rigging elections? 
Then you see the bombings going on in Gaza and‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so difficult to ‚Äúchoose a side‚Äù because at the end of the day I believe it‚Äôs leadership who are fucking over the civilians. Is this about religion? Land? Culture? Power? What is it. 
I have an understanding of what is happening, but the news makes it really difficult to get a grasp of the chaos that is happening. 
It‚Äôs heartbreaking, and I just want to make everything better. Because if there is anything I can understand is a group of ppl taking over your lands. They did that to us in Canada and now we have so many issues. It‚Äôs awful.

&gt; The poll Abdulagatov referred to is in line with a 2015 survey conducted by Dagestan‚Äôs Ministry of Youth Affairs that revealed the growing Islamization of this Russian territory and high levels of support for IS and other extremist organizations among the younger generation. **Over 8 percent of young people interviewed said they were ready to join Islamic State, while another 30.8 percent were undecided.** Many respondents indicated their wish to live in a Shariah state rather than a secular country like Russia (Universiteitleiden.nl, April 2020).

They've been offered a state multiple times and yet still put up a resistance... at some point it stops being a resistance and ends up being an unending, uncompromising attack.

After everything Hamas has been offered, only to decline it. After everything they've done instead of entering good faith negotiations you would have to be naive to believe that they would agree to now negotiate peacefully.

Even if that were the case, it doesn't seem like Hamas would be willing to offer such an alternative. 

The suggestion to ""trust them, they'll stop attacking you once you give them what they want"" seems laughable at this point."

Funny that."

k6zb3fr,"Ok mr ""i know all of the conflict because i watched a couple youtube channels"".
Let's start with that i'm against any unnecessary violence caused by israeli settlers or idf soldiers. We are not perfect and don't categorise all  of us as one person.

1. Britain absolutely didn't give us the land (that was inhabited by both jewish and arab people). What it did was transfer the question about the land to the UN. They had a vote and decided to divide it to roughly half the territory for israel, and half for palestine. Now one thing that you probably don't know is that Israel accepted the plan with joy, and didn't want to fight anymore. It was the arab countries that started the war, not ""zionist colonialists"". This is facts. Not propaganda. You can search it up if you want.

2. Israel **did** occupy gaza until 2005. You know why we got out of gaza? Search up the second intifada. Brutal terrorism attacks were against israeli civilians in those years. Think that you get onto a bus, regular bus, and then a terrorist bombs himself and everyone else in the bus. Do you really think this is justified? Are you going to ignore this? And after all that, we give them water and electricity for peace. Why are we entitled to give them these resources at all?

3. These people tried to cut the fence and get into Israel. Do I need to remind you what happens when they succeed entering Israel? And by the way, it's not an ""open air prison"". Every single day thousands of gazans enter Israel to work. These same people are the same people that entered and killed more than 1400 civilians.

4. Don't just say that it's history. Give me facts, something that happend, anything. I have met many black people in Israel, and none of them are oppressed. You however don't know a single black man from Israel."
k6zb38x,"I just told someone yesterday that it‚Äôs not my job to condemn Hamas, then I shot right back and said I don‚Äôt ever see you condemning the damn near 75 years of israel oppression and killing - he of course completely ignored that part. Fuckin scum."

They gang raped women and filmed it while mocking their victim's plea, shot her, then took turns urinating on her.

Now you understand the meaning?  good.."
k6zav5p,"I would put it simply this: ""Hamas went Full ISIS, NEVER go full ISIS""

Now they got the US there trying to keep the rest of the middle east from jumping in while trying to keep Israel from jumping the shark altogether in Gaza, Hezbollah just said ""nope"" when they realised the shit they stirred up was way too hot and to top it all off Hamas thought it was a good idea to start sucking up to Vatnik Russia ruled by Don Tzar Putin, the biggest Turbocunt on the planet right now who's looking to try and distract the west from Ukraine.

k6zaree,"Hamas is a resistance movement and ideology. By brutally bombing, blockading invading and occupying Gaza, by trying just to dominate the Palestinians even more this time, you will only make people fight back for their freedom even harder.

k6zap2b,"That's not true. Israel has been pressured by the US to change its policies on Gaza. Biden has also spoken against settlers in the west bank since the Israeli government is silent about that.

Israel gets a pass on a lot of things but you forgot that Israel's ""crimes"" are exaggerated and way overreported. This conflict gets way too much attention for its size and its casualty numbers.  
Did you know for example that thousands of people died in the months old Sudanese civil war? That hundreds of thousands died in the 3 year old Tigray conflict just south of Sudan? They are all conflicts close to the middle east, the Sudanese even speak Arabic, yet no one cares.  
The world cares about this conflict only because the perceived oppressors are the Jews. And that changed on October 7th. Now people understand what Jews are defending against."
k6zaoa8,"They often provide aid to Palestinian civilians, who live under a decades-long apartheid regime that denies basic human rights (Human Rights Watch has [formally accused Israel of practicing apartheid](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution), as have [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/) and [B‚ÄôTselem, Israel‚Äôs leading human rights group.](https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_apartheid) 

Not the same thing.

k6zalpa,"If you read my first comment you can understand I don't believe in violence, and I believe the two states solution, but not at all cost, it has its risks. 

It's not ironic, it's plain simple, the fact that my government is run by corrupted people doesn't mean my aim or wants are not true. 

Of course Benjamin Netanyahu as our prime minister for the last 20 years is responsible for this, as well as Hamas. He has blood on his hands, this is not a question. 
He sold a lie to the Israeli public about 'destroying' Hamas while he let Qatar money flow there, and paid money from Israel to Hamas as well. But it's smaller than what Qatar gave them, you can claim it's for humanitarian needs all day, the fact remains the same , Hamas still have rockets while people in Gaza don't have food, you can see clearly where that money went. 

He has responsibility for his lies, for his arrogance and for everything that happened from our side, BUT, and ""that's a big butt and I can't lie. "" 

Hamas are also responsible for what's going on in Gaza, it's not black and white, it's not just one person guilty and that's it, there are many people involved in this terror group creation. Yes, Israel government by Benjamin Netanyahu lead is part of that. So as I said, back in the first comment I still believe in a two state solution, not at all costs. 

It's risky, and this conflict is too bloody for too long, the only possible way in my opinion is that the Palestine state needs to be raised by a peace wanting group and not a terror group or any other group that doesn't want to solve this conflict in a peaceful way. I really believe that, and I really want to believe that after this people will talk differently about each other, I really hope that this will be the last straw for the better people in here, that we will had enough of blood and war in names of gods, and that we can create a reality where we are really equal, and living next to each other peacefully."
k6zalio,"&gt;Israel is only obligated to minimize civilian casualties.    

Israel is NOT obligated to *minimize* civilian casualties. It is only obligated to   
a) strike targets with military value (which can include 'civilian' targets which the enemy military uses in some way)
b) ensure that the harm to civilians will be proportionate to the military value of the damage to the target, from the perspective of a 'reasonable commanding officer'.

This test is supposed to be applied based on the information available at the time of targeting, and the anticipated values for a) &amp; b)."

k6zajci,"I mean the ones of the people actually dying are largely off of social media because they are graphic. 

What exactly are you asking for proof of? 

I showed you body cams, you know they killed civilians (paraded Shani Louk around and spit on her). I described a video and told you where to find it (PM me if you want the specific channel). Do you think it's really a leap that there is body cam footage of them killing civilians? 

I mean I don't think you are trying to be logical I think you are reflexively denying everything. And even if I was willing to scroll through telegram, find the video, upload it, and link it to you I think you'd find a way to justify it, so I'm not going to waste my time because you are the internet equivalent of someone holding their hands over their ears going ""BLAH BLAH BLAH I CAN'T HEAR YOU!"""

k6zaie0,What the hell is happening? People beeing hunted just because of their religion and you are actually proud of it? Are we all devolving back to the stone age?
k6zaic8,Months of supplies for Hamas is like 2 days of supplies for the general populace if it somehow got even distributed. If there is a shortage of food and water it is not those with guns and violence on their side that is going to go without. Randomly killing people in Gaza would have a higher Hamas to Civilian success rate then denying access to basic necessities would. (Which I and most people of course don‚Äôt support)
k6zah47,"I was thinking along the same lines, but I don't think that any of those cases have sufficient parallel lines:

Neither the US nor GB were the only democracies in their region being surrounded by states that more or less overtly support the terror organisation with manpower &amp; logistics.

Taliban where not attacking the US civilian population over several decades, the IRA did not wish to kill every british citizen or protestant."
k6zah3k,"Look, I can't stop you from believing what you want to believe. You are bringing case-by-case evidence which, while I think is biased and has more than questionable validity, even if we accept it, your claim that most of the deaths were IDF caused is ridiculous. Could there sadly have been instances of friendly fire? Sure, it's possible. I was not there. Can we then extrapolate that most of the 1.4k deaths were caused by the IDF?? No!

Please, if you have not already, search on google for the videos that **hamas posted** of their terrible actions. Trust me, their goal was not only to take captives...  


**Warning**: Said videos are very graphic. Watch at your own risk."

k6zag6l,"This is all totally surreal. It's an information war being fought by regular people intentionally spreading misinformation. Palestinians and their allies want people to ""open their eyes wide"" about Jews displacing Muslims in the 50s, but they want them to totally close their mind off to the fact that Muslims displaced Jews in the 1500s. That Jews were there first. 

It's all well and good when warfare unfairly benefits the Muslims, but as soon as the war cuts back on them then its suddenly ""genocide"". It's preposterous."

k6zaf5n,The CIA did the same in Chile..
k6zaeym,"My question is. 

Whilst we who observe from the outside are begging to reduce civlilian casualties. 

How is a government's army supposed to reduce civilian casualties in enemy territory:  **if the enemy combatants live among the civilian populace;**    ?

If you can figure out the answer to that...then you would have solved this conflict."

What I don't think they planned for was Hamas taking over 200 people hostage.

Israel does not only spend an enormous amount of tax funds on security but also jeopardizes the lives of its people. So please tell me, What‚Äôs the point of doing it ‚Äúslowly‚Äù?

k6za5xz,"Not if a two-state solution were negotiated and Palestinians could live in peace and security. Hamas is a resistance movement: remove what it resists ‚Äì the occupation without statehood of Palestinians ‚Äì it would lose its force. UN could force elections and Hamas would lose support.

And then even if Hamas attacks again, isn't that what the Iron Dome and Israel \*Defensive\* Forces are for? Protect Israel, sure; but don't bomb and massacre your own captives because some of them killed some of you in a fit of rage. Maybe set them free; that's why they're so angry.

k6za09y,"are you saying they shouldn't change their policies towards Israel? so Israel is allowed to collectively punish civilians in Gaza and do as they like willy nilly? Hamas might be playing the long game as you say, but that shouldn't be a reason for Israel to continue."

k6z9wwy,The reason they took hostages is because the hyper racist state of Israel is currently running an ethnic cleansing on them. That's a pretty good reason to take a hostage.  Same way the Jews did when confined to the ghettos in Germany.  Or do you view them as terrorists?

k6z9u65,"Yes many willingly left as they thought they‚Äôd get caught up in the fighting. Arab armies also encouraged many to leave, saying they‚Äôd return after they won the war. Many were forcibly expelled, notably in Ramla and Lydda. This is documented. 

Even Mahmoud Abbas says his family fled to Syria, not using the term ‚Äúexpelled‚Äù or ‚Äúdriven out‚Äù. Unlike my family, for example, Iraqi Jews that were forcibly expelled from Iraq."
k6z9tv7,"Since Israel is held to a higher standard ass a ""developed country"" literally anything they do in response to terror attacks, other than rolling over will be seen as bullying a weaker state.

Israel can't win.  If they try to stop hamas, they are committing war crimes, if they don't do anything, then they are letting a terrorist org freely kill their people."

There‚Äôs definitely extremists and hatred. 

The quote from Netanyahu was a quote from the Bible and to me it comes across more to instill courage in soldiers who may see a dead civilian and lay down arms. There will be casualties in war (my interpretation but without context I really don‚Äôt know) 

Second link has no translation just a headline about targeting a family with no context why, where, etc

The third is missing context and is clearly soundbites. If she is really advocating for killing civilians and children that‚Äôs a problem. If she‚Äôs saying you cannot compare targeting children with children being ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù that‚Äôs a separate conversation 


That‚Äôs the major difference here. There‚Äôs no international celebration for killing children in Gaza.  While there was for the killing of Israeli children. 
Israel is not targeting civilians 
Hamas still targets civilians openly 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no symmetry‚Äù it‚Äôs very different scenarios

Other part of muslims ignore the fact of what was done and how was it done. I'm talking about not just killing. I'm talking about raping, cutting heads, killing children in front of the parents. And much more non-himanan action.

Now, about the civilians in Gaza. We did see how did they celebrate deaths in Israel.

And even after that, I do understand that there are some people at Gaza which doesn't like Hamas. But we will not die for them. They need to do the minimum at least. Leave the fighting areas. We son't bomb civilians because it doesn't make any sense. And, they must fight  for their freedom. We will help. We will destroy Hamas.

But Hamas is responsible for the people of Gaza. They use them as human shield.

We try to avoid deaths of civilians. But sorry, we will not risk our lifes for lifes of Gaza people.

Nobody notified the people in Nova festival, or in many kibuts, that Hamas going to kill them.

So sorry. We don't have to supply water and electricity for Hamas so it will be easier to them to kill us. And if people of Gaza don't fight Hamas, they need at least either to shut up and leave the fight area, or pay the price of being blind hamas supporters."

Remember 9/11, the US invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, and there were drone attacks as far as Pakistan. Isreal's response is not unusual, but it feels so brutal because there are so many bombs in such a small area, it so devastating to witness. 

Then there are all these people saying that Israel is exploiting the situation to carpet bonb and take over the territory. It just adds to this fear of what's going to happen.

k6z9054,"&gt;A dictionary definition would be ‚Äúinhabiting or existing in a land from the earliest times or before the arrival of colonists‚Äù. 

That is about what the [UN defines as 'indigenous peoples'](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf). I would say these are fairly applicable distinctions for the peoples of Palestine pre-British Imperialism:

* Historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies 
* Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources 
* Distinct social, economic or political system

Would you agree with these points?

&gt;Israel is a land that has been colonized, recolonized, colonized over again, and then colonized on top of that. The Arab population of the area is a product of colonization, and a huge swell of that population came from the late 19th Century onward, as Muslim nations openly pushed emigration to the area to combat the rise of Jewish immigration. (The Jewish return to their ancestral homeland which had been continually inhabited by some percentage of their population for the last 3500 years, began in the late 19th century.)

Do you have sources for that info? I find it hard to imagine there were mass migrations across great distances occured before steam engines facilitated the ease of such travel. Isn't it more likely the population stayed put while the ruling parties or classes changed? Though am not sure how one could really prove it. DNA tests are a reasonable proxy, but they are probabilistic, not deterministic, and are biased based on their initial samples. 

&gt;Between 1882 and 1914, the Arab population of the area doubled. By 1947, it had doubled again. This wasn‚Äôt due to an explosion in birth rate, it‚Äôs because the Ottoman Empire was shuttling in additional populations by the boatload. By the time the Jewish people (the descendants of the ONLY people in the area who might be considered indigenous today) declared independence from Great Britain in 1948, the overwhelming majority of Arabic peoples in the area hadn‚Äôt been living there for ‚Äòumpteen generations‚Äô, they‚Äôd practically just gotten off the boat.

I studied economic history of West Asia (Middle East) and did not read anything about mass migrations as you describe. Do you have any sources I can read up on? I have a library card and am not afraid of books."

But they can't commit war crimes while doing it. That is the issue, everything else is a distraction. 

There are 3 offices in the world that can do anything they want and get away with it. The President of the US, and the Prime Ministers of the UK and Israel. They could set fire to a baby and broadcast it on global TV and still get away with it. People in the West need to ask themselves why? I don't know the answer. The leadership of Hamas and Israel should both be dragged to the Hague and tried for war crimes, in my view."
k6z8yon,"What exactly was dumb about it? Could you please go into more detail about what exactly you think was dumb? If you strip the conflict down and simply just try to think of a solution that will ACTUALLY work these are the only realistic options. Either kill all the Arabs or leave. Obviously nobody wants option 1 so that leaves option 2. If you‚Äôre going to say a two state solution will work, your oblivious to the fact that the Arab people will NOT get down with it. The Israeli government has been heavily oppressing Gaza for decades. You can‚Äôt expect Gaza to be able to function when they aren‚Äôt allowed to leave. No imports or exports, no trading means no economy. No economy means no jobs and no money. No money equals poverty. Poverty equals anger. Couple their anger with IDF constantly raiding Al Aqsa and mistreating the Arab people in the West Bank, and you get people like HAMAS. In order to address HAMAS you MUST look at why they were created in the first place. This is essential when talking about this conflict."

False Equivalence: The passage implies that because there were no protests in London for various other conflicts or issues in the Middle East, there should be no protests for the Palestinian cause. This is a false equivalence because it assumes that every situation is the same, which is not the case.

Red Herring: It diverts attention from the Palestinian issue by bringing up other conflicts in the Middle East. This is a red herring because it doesn't address the specific concerns related to Palestine.
Cherry-Picking: The passage selectively highlights events where there were no protests for other conflicts and uses this selective data to support its argument.

Appeal to Hypocrisy: It suggests that the lack of protests for other conflicts somehow invalidates or makes hypocritical any protests for Palestine. This is an attempt to undermine the credibility of the Palestinian cause based on unrelated events.

Sweeping Generalization: The passage makes a broad generalization about ""no one marched in the streets of London"" for each of the mentioned events, which may not be entirely accurate."

k6z8cfa,"&gt;Humanitarian aid was blocked officially until saturday by the iof. We simply do not trust your state or president's plans to displace Palestinians in our Sinai. You calling for another country to take them sounds racist to me because it feels like this ""you're all arab, why dont u go sit together and leave us alone"" instead of understanding that we can also feel protective over our land, especially with all the concerns of expansion , excuses to break the peace treaty with lies and murders. The carpet bombing the state is doing has shown that such concerns cannot even be denied or regarded as conspiracies anymore.  Instead of condemning Egypt, (not even such a civilized country you're referring to such as that inflation and poverty has striked hard, and took many sudanese refugees, ) for not taking refugees, why not condemn your government for carpet bombing? How does this make any sense to you and not sound racist?

I do definitly condemn both: Israel¬¥s government for any bombing without starting an evactuation of people and Gaza for sending hunderts of militants/terrorists to Israel everyday and for stopless rocketing Israel everyday (dozens of rockets fall in Gaza strip as well). 

You speak still about who isn¬¥t right, well it is your opinion. An opponent would say, that Palestinian people do ecletct and than many interviews show how they would like to expell or kill the Jews if ""Palestine would be free"" it could be a discussion from another topic. 

However I was deffinitly not speaking about ""who is better in a war"" but about the reaction of the world and a strategy. People just take a side and don¬¥t speak about such way. 

The only logical and fair solution would be:

1) Evacuation (all the countries together take refugees)

2) Anti-terror operation

The same says Mosab Hassan Yousef, born in Rammalah (where his father was one of the honor members of Hamas).  

""Free Gaza from Hamas. Because it is a time to win the war against a world 's most brutal organisation."" then 

""They killed so many Palestinian people at that time and this is when I decided I can not be together with them. In fact, I was asking a question, what will happen if they become a ruling party, if they succeed, what will they do? Opress and kill our people. Then I turned against them. 

Hamas are radicalist and they use Palestinian only to achieve their goal: transforming the Middle East and the world. This is Hamas¬¥s agenda, they are not hiding by the way. This is what Israel is doing: it is a great favor to a Palestinian people. We need to evacuate civilians as much as we can, especially children and women, old people. We need to finish Hamas rule in Gaza, this is priority number one. Then we have to replace the regime, could be a Palestinian authority, Egypt government or Arab League. But firstly finish Hamas""."

They have rockets (made from recycled materials) which has also been confirmed by the israeli government, there are photos and videos uploaded by the idf and israeli civilians showing the damage done by these rockets when they get through the iron dome (which is about 1 in a 5,000 chance) it can barely completely destroy a car, 4 rockets hit one building and all the damage was a slightly broken roof and broken windows (this was shared by the idf and journalists, i can find them and show if you want) hamas also has 40,000 soldiers AT MOST compared to 600,000 on israel‚Äôs side + US soldiers if they decide to help out. also half of the population in gaza are children, about 1.1-1.2 million. there is a blockade, a siege, these people have no food, water or electricity and they cant leave.

Israel has similar security fences between its borders with the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring countries.

Was she calling for terrorism ~~or calling for peaceful reunification~~?  I guess we'd have to know more context, the government appears to think it was the former.  edit: *Additional information not included in this article appears to suggest she was indeed celebrating the attack by Hamas*.

This may be shocking to hear, but they didn't.  There are actually people in Gaza who didn't know Hamas was about to ruin Gaza for good.

k6z76qq,"The situation involved various weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles, RPGs, and a significant number of rocket launches from the Gaza Strip, which is more serious than just having machine guns and small grenade launchers. It's essential to consider the context. In some videos, it appeared that terrorists had already entered and harmed people. This can explain why hostages may have been caught in the crossfire, as the base was fired upon to eliminate the terrorists, not the soldiers. It's a tragedy that there may be unreleased videos showing further atrocities. Unfortunately, there are also instances of terrorists targeting civilians, making it clear that not all actions were directed solely at military targets. It's not accurate to claim that no terrorists harmed civilians."
k6z76gz,"So based on your logic no country needs an army, right? Why do countries need bombs, right?
It‚Äôs very cute that you think you can win a terror organization with kind words. When ISIS will rape, kill and kidnap your family, use the strategy you‚Äôre preaching. Till then, what makes you think you know better? Honest question. What experience do you have with Islamic fundamentalists and terror? Have you ever released hostages? Because If you can contribute to this very expensive and painful war maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be preaching on Reddit, maybe you should apply for the IDF as a strategic advisor?

k6z72so,"&gt;So you recognize jews getting kicked out was wrong, but not when it happens to Arabs?

You avoided my question.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saying a two state solution as proposed in 1948 would have been an acceptable outcome. Which more or less set the boundaries that came in1949 Armistice Agreements.

&amp;#x200B;

Then what happened? Yep that's right! zionists wanted more, a two state solution was never acceptable for zionist, merely a springboard to eventually take more and more.

Look at how much the west bank has shrunk since 1949.

k6z724f,"First of all, Israel already commanded that the Arabs move south, away from Gaza city. When the civilians started moving in caravans out of the north, to the south, the IDF bombed the convoy. So what now? They‚Äôre literally bombing the civilians as they‚Äôre trying to do what they‚Äôve been told. There‚Äôs videos of the convoy getting annihilated. You say ‚Äúmilitary goes in and destroys Hamas and then let the civilians back in afterwards‚Äù. If you think that Israel‚Äôs plan is to give Gaza back to Arabs you‚Äôre insane. And if you think that eliminating HAMAS is possible you‚Äôre very naive (not trying to insult). The more Hamas you kill, the more that will be created. The more civilians you kill, the more Hamas militants will be created. Over half the population in gaza is under 14 years old. When these kids are having their friends or brothers or sisters or mothers or fathers etc, getting blown up, they‚Äôre going to grow up with hatred for the ones who killed them. They will eventually grow up to be Hamas.

The second option that I suggested eliminates all death destruction and casualties. Which would be for Israel to dissipate and leave the area. This is realistically the only solution if you think about it hard enough."

It's really unfortunate civilians are being caught in the crossfire but no matter what, people are going to die.

k6z6wbd,"&gt; Certainly compared to the left, Likud considered peace a much lower priority. They disliked Oslo... Netanyahu made running against it the centerpiece of his 1990s campaign, and certainly undermined it in office. Given that even Labor couldn't get to a workable Oslo type deal Likud had no chance.

Labor had their issues in making peace as well but Likud particularly bothers me because they never wanted to consider a serious 2ss at all regardless of how willing Palestinians were. Failure of peace talks involving labor and Palestinians can at least be attributed to other factors like squabbling over Jerusalem or borders and whatnot as opposed to the belief on the side of the Israeli right that Israel and only Israel has a right to the entire region which automatically shuts down any negotiations. 

&gt; That being said I think Netanyahu's Economic Peace was vastly more serious than the 2SS negotiations. Economic Peace was something that could get through the Knesset what the Palestinians were asking for was not. Further Economic Peace is a win-win situation. It avoids the problem of ""what can the Palestinians possible give worth all of X,Y,Z"". It also ducks the problem of history.

Rejecting serious political negotiations, the idea that the Israeli right might have to make some serious land concessions and rejecting a workable Palestinian state as a matter of policy while diverting more effort to economics is just silly, ignoring the political issues won't make them go away. I don't think Israel wants a strong, sustainable Palestinian middle class, since that same middle class will immediately demand political rights. I remember reading somewhere that the newfound economic status many Palestinians would find themselves in as a result of this hypothetical policy succeeding could serve as a carrot in a carrot and stick approach towards Palestinians for them to ignore political rights, after all in order to get a work permit for Israel, I believe a Palestinian needs to be uninvolved in all political activities, and is sometimes even asked to spy on his neighbors or family members. Collaborators are an essential part of the system. Perhaps there's an expectation that Palestinians will settle for relatively better living conditions that require them to be apolitical so their politics won't be an issue anymore and Israel can use them as a disenfranchised source of cheap labor since Palestinians would rely on Israel for their livelihood and thus couldn't risk it by being political? In any case Likud doesn't have a serious political framework to make any of this work in. The political and economic issues are fundamentally tied, I believe that was the position labor had which I agree with.

&gt; I think they mean it more literally. Jews and Palestinians living as neighbors in peace.

If they were using the term literally then it would imply separate states, if people are living in what essentially is the same hypothetical 1ss country they're not really your neighbors. Sort of like how Mizrahi jews and ashkenazi Jews aren't 'neighbors' in Israel, even though you might say Tel Aviv-ians neighbor Holonians. 

&gt; I partially agree. Israel has a serious problem in that the Israeli left. They want a Jewish nationality being overwhelming in Israel where the nationality is determined by race. Making Jews into a race not a nationality is a betrayal of Zionism. But in any case the Israeli left was highly influenced by European attitudes towards Arabs.
&gt; The Israeli right traditionally was much less racist. They tended to view their situation with the Palestinians as situational not racial. Jabotinsky's Iron Wall on the one hand is harsh but on the other thinks of Palestinians as equal people who just happen to be the enemy. Peace with Arabs will be achieved the same way France and Germany have peace, when they have a confluence not a conflict of interests. FWIW I agree strongly with the traditional Israeli right.

I think you're mixing them up, it is the Israeli left who view the situation with Palestinians as being situational rather than racial. The left are moreso legitimate proponents of minority and Palestinian rights as opposed to the right. It is the right who moreso make the nationality in Israel be determined by race. 

As for the Iron wall there's an unmistakable degree of racial supremacy present there. Jabotisnky was a maximalist proponent of a Jewish state regardless of to what degree it would be built at the expense of Arabs due to his ethnic/ingroup bias."

There are even countries and international organizations that are calling for a ceasefire while proposing to do nothing about the ever-present threat Israeli civilians face from Hamas. Israel is not even allowed to cut the communication lines of the enemies that have murdered and raped their women and children. They are even expected to supply these very same enemies.

Point that question to those who started and perpetuate this conflict.  
This war is not going to end before Gaza is disarmed. And it's not Israel's choice if that will happen peacefully or by force. And either way, Israel has the right and the obligation to do it.

You do not walk into another country, murder 1400 people, gang rape women and take babies and holocaust survivors as hostages, and expect it to be business as usual afterwards.  
I think you're ingenuous. But I'll still humor you.

k6z5gj0,"You have to go to other subs which are predominantly pro-Hamas like r/Palestine if you want more of a monoculture of opinion leaning in the direction of Hamas.

You may or not agree, but I think right now on this sub, opinion is mixed both in posts and comments. I don‚Äôt think any fair minded person would say pro-Hamas comments or users are being deleted/banned on the basis of politics, content or position only.

This doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs a balance or any kind of 50:50.  We mods can‚Äôt influence which random Redditors read and post here.  This also has nothing to do with the politics of mods or how many of which mods there are or aren‚Äôt.

We remove comments and ban users not on basis of politics but rules violations. Rules are basically be civil, don‚Äôt attack other users (mostly rude name calling), don‚Äôt troll, don‚Äôt flame-bait, don‚Äôt spam, no gross trolling mis/disinformation (e.g., ‚Äúno proof babies killed‚Äù).

Is there some discretion and possible bias involved? Maybe, but our moderation and warnings are public and can be appealed.  Our rules are relatively clear cut and apply to both sides.

Can you find **plenty** of pro-Palestine, even pro-Hamas content and posters on this sub right now?  The bias question answers itself to good faith commenters about the meta here."

We learned from history mistakes not to do it again. If any Islamic Jihad organization like Hamas has common sense, they shouldn't copy what ISIS had done. Because ISIS was destroyed because of islamic terrorism killing unarmed innocent civillians; be it a grown man, woman, elderly and babies. NEVER touched the unarmed innocent civillians or you will be wipe out like ISIS. Tell that to your Jihadist friends. Fight soldiers to soldiers. Don't be a coward.

I'm not claiming that Israelis are all racist or whatever. Clearly not. But I am making a valid and intellectually honest claim that the current ruling government running this war is composed of terrorist sympathizers/supporters (like Ben Gvir and his hard-on for Baruch Goldstein) and a bunch of ""moderates"" who don't believe in the two-state solution at all (like most of the Likudniks + obviously Bibi)"
k6z53ja,"you're not even israeli but you call yourself a colonizer, funny

and you've never went there before yet you're living in ""diaspora""? ü§£ delusional"
k6z53g1,"I agree that Hamas should be defunded and pushed out. With the calls for a ceasefire, they should also be calling for the release of the hostages."
k6z523h,"&gt; Gaza has 2.1M people living in a strip that is considered one of the most populated areas in the world. Top 5 as far as density.

Egypt and Jordan have more reasons not to take them. Those countries couldn't handle any more refugees."
k6z4zxq,"And Hamas, who can literally see the 2 U.S. carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean from Gaza, might also take that into consideration"
k6z4yqy,"&gt; Civilian casualties are the price of war 

Let's put pro-Hamas westerners aside. They are the minority anyway. The majority of westerners are not naive enough to believe that all civilian casualties can be avoided in war. However, where you all are losing people is that you don't seem to have any cap on ""civilian casualties are the price of war."" 

Where is the tipping point for you? Would 10,000 dead Gazans be excessive to you? Would 100,000? Would 1,000,000 dead Gazans push you to the point that you say ""Okay, we are killing too many civilians""?"
k6z4y99,"Can they go to the West Bank? Do they have a working airport? Or was it blown up‚Ä¶  

Anyway, if Gaza is supposed to be an independent state, then how can that be if they have no independent access to food, water, and power? And all their resources were forcibly taken and controlled? 

Believe what you wish, but when the world sees thousands of dead Gazan children, died of starvation, bombing, and dehydration, I‚Äôm not so sure Americans will want to die for this ‚Äúcause‚Äù. If this continues, then Israel should expect to stand on its own feet without any support. 

That is certainly not to say israel shouldn‚Äôt exist nor than Hamas should (as it certainly shouldn‚Äôt). However, if this continues, then Israel‚Äôs existence will be threatened by the fact that their actions have made them indefensible. The fact is that, as the more technologically and culturally advanced country, israel should not be taking the ‚Äúlow road‚Äù if it wants to keep its few remaining allies."
k6z4wsj,"Since the media here in the US likes to do this whole both sides, thing, here‚Äôs the other side of that headline:

Hamas benefits from dead and displaced civilians, not peace treaties, negotiations, ceasefires, etc. They're terrorists. that's why they are still holding hostages."

k6z4bkp,And the cycle of violence continues...
k6z4bdw,"And that's the rub, I don't see Israel under Netanyahu/Likud actually moving towards peace by attempting their own Martial Plan. Especially when we know that Netanyahu and Likud have actively sabotaged peace for the past 25 years. This is what the UN Secretary General's comments about the Hamas attacks ""not happening in a vacuum"" were getting at. They initial attack by Hamas was horrific and Hamas needs to be destroyed, but arguably the reason we got to this point where we only have shit choices, is because of Netanyahu and Likud and their propping up of Hamas while sabotaging the Oslo accords."
k6z4b8h,"Sadly, a great brisket isn't the answer to world peace =("

k6z43kt,"This is categorically incorrect.

Hamas wasn‚Äôt elected to any sort of full power ever. They won a slim plurality of the vote in 2006 (44% to Fatah‚Äôs 41%, with 15% of the vote going to other parties). But that was a *parliamentary* election. They had to share control with those other parties.

And they couldn‚Äôt do that. So in 2007, they orchestrated a coup and took power by force, and murdered opposition leaders. They‚Äôve murdered over 600 opposition leaders in the years since. They rule by force and through terror.

This idea that they were elected to full power, and therefore Palestinian civilians (75% of whom were between the ages of 8 and not alive yet when the election even happened) have this coming is nonsense. Hamas as it currently rules was not elected, the took control in a civil war. And even when they did win an election, the majority of voters voted against them."

Our government was too busy trying to protect themselves after trying to pass a law allowing them to strong arm the supreme court (which led to gigantic parts of the country rebelling), and didn't bother trying to protect its own citizens well enough.

k6z3qm2,"I see plenty of pro palestinian comments and posts, i fact i found this sub to be one of thr only ones that dont have a decisive echo chamber of one side or the other. Although it is leaning towords israel, because imo thats simply what makes sense to most logical people. If you want some more dramaitized pro palestine posts i suggest looking... anywhere on reddit at the moment, this sub, and world news sub are the only ones who actually have good takes usually. Everywhere else, pure propoganda and misinformation 90% of the time."
k6z3pyc,"Would they move to a safe location? Most would. Hamas wouldn't. As far as cost, you're looking at relocating about 400,000 families. Give or take. $50,000  per family is $20 billion. That's 5 years of aid."
k6z3pba,"I love how Hamas health ministry puts out ""500 dead and hospital leveled"" declaration instantly; and of course the pro-""Palestine"" crowd instantly bought their lies and started repeating them, including international politicians. Turns out it was terrorists who caused the very modest sized parking lot fire (no building leveling at all) and it killed maybe 100 but likely much less."

k6z3nby,"And Muslims will continue to do what they‚Äôve been doing for almost a century now - treating Jews within their own country like shit, bolstering the notion that Jews can only be safe in their own state. Muslims and Arabs must reconcile with the fact that their own hostility towards Jews in their countries was a major cause of Israeli colonialism."
k6z3n1j,"The original sin is the Zionist project period. We are kind of past all that now but that's the root of this whole problem. Any reasonable analysis would show that. Now I understand why Jewish people wanted to do it and I may have been a Zionist myself had I been Jewish in the early 1900s. However, the project was clearly unfair to the people living there at the time and the starting point of the conflict."

k6z3jhi,"Oh yeah the same country that has been defending itself from multiple hostile nations and has become a thriving hub of economy and democracy in the sea of the oppressive islamic states obviously is doing a horrible job at protecting their citizens. What's your argument? 

I could say it's not possible for peace when extremists who commit acts of terrorism and mistreat their own population and the entire world threatens Israel when they lift a finger and do anything until it reaches a point where Israel is forced to respond.

But what is the peaceful solution for israelis and palestinians living on that small slice of land between the river and the sea?

k6z3feu,"If you don't know what's happening there, then don't speak. Do you think Palestinians have the right to build any shelters? Israel is observing them all the time and limiting their moves. And btw If they built them, Israel will claim as it's ady doing that there's Hamas in those shelters and will just bomb them as it did with Mosques, churches, hospital, schools, etc.
""THEY USE CIVILIANS AS HUMAN SHIELDS"". Do you refer to all the buildings which Israel bombed claiming Hamas in it? How many Hamas members got killed? And how many children got killed? Don't you know Israel is also attacking Lebanon, Syria and Yemen? That's what you call a terrorist country."
k6z3ffa,"They feel ""Israeli aggression"" because they keep instigating the Israelis. Since day 1 they were the aggressors so they need to be the one to lay down there arms first. Give Palestine an army and you get a war with Israel or a genocide of Jews."

k6z3ebb,Classic case of tell me who your friends are and I‚Äôll tell you who you are. Hamas is supported by Russia and Iran and to a lesser extent by North Korea.
k6z3cxp,"as a human rights journalist who has fortunately been able to use their (albeit small) platform to shed a light on the ethnic cleansing happening in gaza: i am so sorry. 

to every palestinian, i am so sorry that western journalism is failing you right now. i am so sorry that those responsible for holding those in power accountable have instead decided to protect them. i weep not just for the thousands of palestinian lives lost, but for the loss of truth itself as journalists publish israel lies and justify colonialist violence. 

all of these stories will be available when the dust settles. in the digital age, nothing will ever disappear. we will know who published, who justified, and history will eviscerate their character as it has every leader, every civilian, every soldier, every celebrity, every journalist, who has knowingly or unknowingly facilitated genocide."

k6z3adv,"I would argue that Israel needs the funding to keep the ""status quo"" of having the iron-dome munitions to maintain it's defense status and still have Hamas in the other side of the border.
If someone were to remove that funding, we would either  get more people eager to either make peace or war to prevent bigger economic losses (imho entering this ""status quo"" state was in it of itself a cause of many of the following issues, but I'm not sure what practical alternatives were there at the time).

From my familiarity with this area, the result would likely be war."

k6z307d,"Looking for original sins here, isn‚Äôt it true that the Arab side rejected the original UN Resolution 181 of 11/29/47 calling for partition and launched a war instead? A war which they lost but refused to negotiate a peace treaty dealing with refugees, only signing a cease fire?

How do you get to pick and choose which UN decisions your side will follow? Doesn‚Äôt your failure to ever endorse the UN partition but rather pointedly reject it with the trollish ‚ÄúRiver to sea‚Äù demands hamper you from relying on **other** UN resolutions you find more to your liking (now that modern UN is full of tiny third world states no one could find on a map that have the same one vote that the U.S. and Israel do)?

&gt; This war is so tactically insane and irrational that I can barely even offer commentary on it.

I think this sums it up pretty well. Hamas basically wants to keep the region unstable. If people are getting along, how can they have their ""holy war""? Israeli government probably wants to be done with what I am sure they see as their ""Gaza problem."" This whole situation is a nightmare."

Only a handful of nations world wide are able to perform such surgical strikes as the Israelis do. Everybody else just lacks the precision. Look at Russian ""smart bomb kits"" which often miss their targets by a hundred meters. Here we are seeing them leveling buildings while the building across the street stays largely undamaged.

Also tell me which countries to warn people inside a building that it will get destroyed soon, even though it enables the fighters of the enemies to escape, too?

And please enlighten us with this looooooong ""bigger history of ""we thought its Hamas"""""

Lol, lmao, etc. I am single-handedly beating off all y'all's warmed-over IDF takes in the replies. Not a single Palestinian supporter here. All the top posts in this sub are from the Israeli point of view. Pro-Palestinian writers and other figures are being fired or cancelled. The US backs Israel with billions per year for weapons, we veto any UN resolution criticising them, the West bends to and is complicit in the Israeli point of view, but yeah sure let's always make sure not to forget the Israeli point of view"

'''Few things get me more irritated than supporters of group that starts a major conflict and, when it becomes apparent that it‚Äôs not going how they planned, suddenly become super concerned about things like ‚Äúthe children‚Äù and call for an immediate cease fire.

Centuries of human conflict have repeatedly demonstrated that, if you start something, you‚Äôd damn well better able to finish it or suffer the consequences.

Most of these Palestinian protestors who now so desperately want a cease fire are just upset that Hamas wasn‚Äôt able to sustain their success and are now paying the price. If the IDF was in ruins and Hamas forces were steadily advancing towards Tel Aviv, I guarantee they‚Äôd all be doing something else on this fine afternoon in London than calling for peace.

Same f-ing story for the last 75 years: launch a surprise attack, then play the victim when Israeli hits back infinitely harder. Crap, even Egypt figured out that it was a stupid game to play and got out 45 years ''''"

I assure you they are not pro Palestine whatsoever. These people praise ISIS and the Taliban because of their mistreatment of women.

Oppression is oppression. Murder is murder. War crimes are war crimes. Torture is torture. None of those things are excusable. Even death row is murder because there are other ways to keep people who just can‚Äôt help themselves out of society, and many who have been killed by their own state have later been found innocent.

k6z21cr,The issue Israel is facing is that these bombings are only going to do light damage to hamas. Hamas is well dug in with everything they need underground.

Do they? Because last I checked, Palestinians and Arabs gladly celebrated the actions of Hamas on the 7th.

&gt;Pro-Israeli, on the other hand, are so blinded by their thirst for supremacy and power that they completely forget about the actions of the IDF and Israeli governement for the past 75 years

Is that so? Because even in this sub, many people will condemn some of Israel's actions. You know why? Because not all actions are worth to be condemned.

According to the same UN, which the general secretary won't even condemn Hamas and blame Israel? The same UN who has Iran, Russia, China etc... In their human and women rights councils? Yeah, so excuse me for not trusting the UN. And what international laws did Israel break?

&gt;When Palestinians are restricted in their movement and have no independence, no privacy and no Freedom

And who's fault is it that they don't have independence? Surely not the fault of themselves who refused every single peace treaty and the opportunity to build a sovereign state.

And who's fault is that they have no privacy and freedom? Surely not the fault of themselves that they constantly launch terror attacks.

You seriously can't even hold them accountable for their actions. Everything they do is the fault of Israel, right? Palestinians have no accountability at all.

&gt;Hamas wasn't there before 87, yet the killing of civilians happened since the beginning.

And Israel wasn't there before 1948, yet the killing of Jews happened since the late 1800's.

&gt;So convenient for Israeli to have an enemy to fight off everytime

So convenient to be ""knowledgeable"" on a situation you probably didn't even hear of until a month ago, while you live far away from the area, which you never even visited.

&gt;why are people in Israel protesting against the actions of the governement

Israelis want to have the hostages returned first. That is their priority. Their second priority is to eliminate Hamas. That's why they protest. Because Israel's priorities are opposite. First eliminate Hamas and then return the hostages.

&gt;why are jews all around the world protesting in support of the Palestinians?

In before you're gonna show me a picture of Neturei Karta. A group so small, they probably don't even make 1% of the Jewish population.

&gt;Are the 120 countries that voted yes for a ceasefire deluded? 

And why should Israel care about such vote?

&gt;Is it normal for the US to put their veto for an issue that doesn't concern them? Oh yeah right, it does concern them... Wanting power, petrol and money is more important than human lives I guess

So you're blaming Israel for getting support from the US? Hmm I wonder why you would do such thing.

&gt;And yes I can tell you that these 7000 deaths are civilians. Go check the official 212 pages document the palestinians authority (PA) has just released. Names of all the victims with age and sex.

And can you tell me who's a civilian and who isn't? Oh that's right, you can't, because Hamas doesn't say. You're immediately assume that this list is entirely civilian.

&gt;You're gonna tell me now that new-born babies and 5 years Olds are terrorist or Hamas?! Are you this serious?

It seems like you're the one who says it.

&gt;For the CTV cameras, they are pointed into the Palestinaians house

Those are not Israeli cameras. Israel doesn't install them.

&gt;Checkpoints, infringement of liberty of movement

And you failed to answer when these checkpoints came to be and why. ""Whatever I say, goes in one hear and exits the other.""

&gt;But I gues it's normal for you, for a 2million + people to be encircled and trapped in a human case with no control of their water and electricity supply

I'm confused. Because clearly you're talking about Gaza here, but you mention checkpoints who don't exist in Gaza. You're ao ipl informed that you don't even know the difference between Gaza and the West Bank. Which comes to my conclusion that you're unknowledgeable and have zero relations to this conflict.

&gt;Btw you drew a comparison with Bin laden. Are you seriously comparing Bin laden and his militants to civilians 

Where did I compare bin laden to *CIVILIANS*?

&gt;And anyways when they killed Bin laden they avoided civilian casualties

Yeah, they only killed his entire family.

&gt;something the IDF should take as an example since they can't even aim properly and hit Egypt.

You're talking about aiming properly while 20% of Hamas rockets land in Gaza. Heck, even launches from Lebanon land in Syria. Yemen launched a drone last week that hit Egypt.

But I don't see you talking about that right? Because that's normal Arab violence. It's only important when Jews are involved.

&gt;You say the jews are indeginous to the land, go read and not the ones written by Israeli authorities or media.

So the definiton of indigenousity is written by the Israeli authority or media? Sounds pretty anti.... to me.

&gt;An indeginous people means that they are the EARLIEST civilization to the land

Yeah, which are Jews.

&gt;The land of Canaan, where Canaanites, Amorites, Assyrians, Hamites and Arabs were present before the jews

You do realize that the Arabs came to this land in the 7th century, while Jews lived here? Oh, you probably don't. So id Jews lived here before Arabs, by *YOUR* words, Jews are indigeous.

&gt;Even with the story of Moses peace be upon him. He took the enslaved jews out of Egypt to move to Canaan, a promised land of God according to them. How can they move to a place they are already supposed to be there.

Again, you're using the Torah. No Jew uses this argument.

&gt;You're gonna tell me about the argument about the fact that there were jews 3000 years later, well there were peoples before that. 

Yeah, and? Jews are the *OLDEST* group of people who lived in the region. Unless you know an existing Canaanite group of people, Jews are the oldest group.

&gt;Regardless of this argument, what is important is that in 48, when holocaust survivors arrived

Only you're forgetting that Jews immigrated long befor 1948.

&gt;Palestinians with passeports, with land of their ancestors that were them displaced during the 1948 war. 

Most of the land wasn't occupied, nor privately owned. Oh, and can you tell me who Palestinians were pre 1967? A name of a famous Palestinian pre 1967? Because I asked that question multiple times and no one was able to give me an answer. Maybe you could, because you're clearly so knowledgeable.

And like I said in my last comment, it is clear you have no real idea about the conflict, and that you are being brainwashed by Al Jazeera and tiktok videos. It is clear that you never stepped foot in the region, and typing it all from the comfort of your house far far away. It is clear that you are ill informed."
k6z1v7w,"The US is probably a HUGE deterrent here. One of those aircraft carriers could level all of Lebanon, and it just isnt worth it for Iran to lose their proxy that easily."
k6z1v13,"Was it okay for the USA doing it in Iraq and Syria? War is war. War is never ""okay"". Western war ethics are important to stick to. But when only one side puts effort into sticking to it and the other is following no war ethics at all, not respecting any human rights of its civilians, I don't think that the blaming finger can be pointed at Israel.
Any conflict which martyrdom fueled organizations participates in, will take a big cost of civilian life on either side of the conflict. See USA in Iraq, civilian war in Syria, war against ISIS.
There is a huge asymmetry between both sides. Culture, ideals, morals, cause and means, combat doctrines. People tend to disregard it when observing from the side. But to us who participate in the conflict it is very clear."

k6z1moy,"I don't think it's true that they are bombing ""all over"" southern Gaza. You said that for rhetorical effect. It's the northern area that is receiving most of the shelling.

Bombing a hospital is not actually a war crime if the hospital is being used to host non-medical military operations. It becomes a legitimate target then. You're right, I don't know if this exact hospital has military equipment in it, but neither do you. The tenability of both our positions hinges on this fact. However, what we do know is that it is a pattern of behavior for Hamas to use residential areas.

You don't have to be a monster to bomb a hospital; you just need to have a sense of self-preservation. What is being lost in all these discussions about this conflict is the Israeli point of view. Hamas launches thousands of rockets that reach inside the borders of Israel. Thankfully, carnage is often averted due to the Iron Dome, but not always. Isn't that worth considering? Israel has a right to defend themselves. And you criticize the Israelis for refraining from a ground invasion because they don't want to risk their lives. You bet they don't. Who would? Minimizing your losses and maximizing the success of your objective is the intelligent thing to do."

k6z1kbj,"See, now you‚Äôre a bit closer. Most Israelis want this government gone due to this obvious incompetence and horrific decision making. You should go watch some Israeli news.

k6z1ivo,"This isn't a lack of empathy, it's that the reality doesn't change because one side feels bad. They will likely feel terrified, but the feelings will end quickly.

There's a reason Israel told Gazans to go South, and it was specifically to avoid such situations. So I'm not going to play your game where you're trying to paint soldiers who are trying to survive in a bad light. If they intentionally attacked civilians that's something else but you can't just go attack every instance labeling it war crimes or genocide."

As for realistic proposals ... the realistic proposal is obviously that Israel is the sole successor state to the British Mandate for Palestine.  Gazans were granted independence.  After 17 years of tying their best to get Israelis to reverse course on trying to have Gaza be independent won a battle and are now successful.  The most likely outcome is some sort of autonomy system inside Israel.  That's realism.  

BDSism became popular as the 2nd Intifada failed and it became clear that Camp David / Taba were the best offers possible.  It is an escapist fantasy.  The idea that Jews would ever abandon Zionism, sell their progeny back into slavery so as to avoid sanctions.  Rather than say make minor alterations to their economy. 

There is no realism."

Yeah, I know. The protest for rohingyans happened, its just the world see them as no value. The media could not care less. maybe if we bomb a few places in their name, maybe then the world would care.

&gt;I do support humanity, but I truly don‚Äôt know what is humane thing to do when a nation is attacked and civilians massacred? I don‚Äôt want to see dead babies in Gaza or Israel‚Ä¶ when the world was appalled by Isis crimes against people the protested it. There was a war, just in Mosul, the stronghold of Isis there were thousands of civilian death, babies, women‚Ä¶ was it not horrible? It was‚Ä¶ my heart aches to each and one of them, but should have US and the coalitions not fought Isis? How do you fight a terrorist regime? Giving cookies or concessions doesn‚Äôt help.

To you its a terrorist regime, to others its their freedom fighter. It's an ideology. But if you want to win, you fight them with hope. American won the fight with ISIS in iraq by helping the then government to re-enfranchise the sunnis into the government. Then the Iraqis themselves, with the help of the Americans and coalition, helped and supported them. 
In Malaya ( before the formation of Malaysia), we defeated communist insurgency with the simple act of getting our independence from the British. The ideologies never gonna go away. ISIS and communist are still around, but they are weak, and people do not need them.

Right now, you bombing them are not gonna solve anything. Try empathy. Put yourself in the shoes of a Palestinian. If you are in gaza, you only hope is Hamas. If you are looking for hope for a place without Hamas, you will see West Bank as an example. Do you think you would like to live in West Bank as a Palestinian?


&gt;But they didn‚Äôt, and they didn‚Äôt do that intentionally. They targeted schools and kindergartens - intentionally. They had areal maps with markings of schools and kindergartens. Who kidnaps babies?!

An individual can be viewed a part of a group of people, so, unless this definition is modified somehow by other sources of law, as the OP insinuates, it is ridiculously broad.

Thanks for proving my point. If security was a concern wouldn‚Äôt you rather be looking for something more permanent? 

Also it‚Äôs amusing that you brought up Hiroshima. The Nazis had already been defeated in 1943. There was no reason for US to drop a nuke over civilians."
k6yyyw3,Honestly convinced they‚Äôre trying to make an example out of Gaza at this point to deter others from joining

No in the West Bank the occupation and slow house building and movement is wrong.  In Gaza this has had to happen because of the actions Hamas and those before them did before there was a hard border.  

Two wrong things can happen at once.  But to wave the Palestine flag and chant from the river to the sea and think that would be anything other than all out slaughter is delusional. It‚Äôs not only been show in the last few weeks but through the history.  There are not chants to get back Jordan or Syria into palatine. Just a certain date and time.  No counter protests calling for the Canaanites to reclaimed their land. Just a specific time and place and only those that‚Äôs not in the hands of other Muslims."

This is an option that would defisafe lives but I think there are two reasons this isn't happening: 

1. Eygpt and other neighbouring countries dont want to take them in because of the civil unrest they have caused in the past. 
2. They think if they leave, Israel will never let them back in. They look at the West Bank and see those illegal settlements, so think the same will happen to Gaza

k6yypec,"And as a seasoned journalist with numerous connections within intelligence agencies your sources are?
Avoiding civilian casualties is inscribed into the DNA of the IDF. The IDF has been proven by many objective sources to be one of the most moral in the world. Take it from someone who has served on the Gaza border and support the idea of a two states solution. I'm perfectly capble of critical thinking about the IDF and my government's actions and I do it regularly.
You however, a couch potato that sits 2000 miles away and all he knows about this conflict is what the BBC and CNN tells him is not capble of that. A single photo without a context is definitely not a dependable source of information. But you wouldn't know about that would you?"
k6yyoyv,"No it didn't happen
I asked him for a source
He provided me with one
No direct donation from israel to palestine

k6yyltr,"how do you avoid the intent? if your enemy is a part of another group of people and you intend to kill them, from the outside looking in, especially if your perspective is already hostile to one of the groups and sympathetic to the other, I'm sure it would be very easy for them to assume that one party *only* wants to kill members of the other party because they're a part of group B and not group A"
k6yyln2,Isn't isolating Gaza what Israel has been doing for years and led to this?  It seems like they need to govern the place to prevent Hamas from doing so or at least prevent Hamas from overthrowing the Palestinian Authority again?
k6yylb9,"No, let it stay up, i want people to see how israeli jews are on the inside"

I suggest if this is all you have, try harder."
k6yyifr,"I replied to my own comment because clearly you‚Äôre not emotionally stable enough to have a conversation.

This strike was probably planned with a few guarantees in mind from several larger regional players, and they just haven't panned out at all. Hamas have given up all of their security expecting some sort of success in their offensive but now they're totally isolated, outmatched, and are basically waiting to get snuffed out, and not only that but the blood of thousands of innocent Palestinians are now on their hands.

And how all Hamas can do is sit there and count there incredibly little victories... like, ""Well, at least Netanyahu will probably get voted out next term""...

k6yxzg5,"1- I'm talking about when Britain decided to give away land that had inhabitants in it when the war was over and colonizing publicly was no longer okay... I'm pretty sure you know that's what I'm talking about too... Palestine was under review as a potential new home before ww2 even broke out.

2- The world is not supporting the genocide and ethics cleansing that's taking place, but the world has always been supporting Israel's cause to make up for thier ww2 guilt. What Israel tried to achieve is apartheid and succeed, what do you call the ethnic segregation with the 5 resident cards? Even the arab israelis who have accepted your terms and live among you are discriminated against legally.

3- You can thank your government for the existence of Hamas in the first place... I never condone violence, but you're just cleaning your own mess at this point.

4- The Holocaust is a stain on history and the human consciousness. But it doesn't justify stealing someone else's home. Why didn't the UK make a place for you there, why didn't the US make some space for you there? Why send you off to the middle east? They literally called you an investment.
Palestinians are the confused segment that had that reality imposed on them since the start, why would they be okay it? Is violence the answer? No. But violence has been your government's approach... Do you know how many massacres the Palestinians have been through just between 1937 and 1948 here are 44 of them (https://thepalestineproject.medium.com/notorious-massacres-of-palestinians-between-1937-1948-ae4f4d1f61d0)
This is the foundation of your relationship with the Palestinians.

5- call it whatever you want to call it, people are dying, people out being starved out and cut off from the rest of the world with every aspect of their lives under heavy control. 2913 children as of October 26.

6- We can argue about scholars all day but eventually the facts are there for those looking, I'm talking from a historical perspective no more. And no, Jews, Muslims and Christians in that region have always coexisted locally, they kill each other every now and then in the name of god because that was all the rage back then but I visited Syria before the war and I met all kinds of people there, been to synagogues, churches and mosques... The issue is that you want a jew only state, a theocratic state. A ludicrous demand in this day and age. 
No one wants you to go like a lamb to the butcher, no one wants you to leave even, they just want you to actually coexist in the land you came as refugees to... No one goes to a new country and demands to start their own in it.

7- look man, you do you, the Americans killed the natives and now say sorry in the most ridiculous ways but it doesn't bring back the dead, that will eventually be you once you finish wiping out the native population. I won't come at you with all that ""you've become what you feared"" talk but just try to look past your government's propaganda for a second and think for yourself."

Never in a million years will I stand on the side of the aggressors. We are taught growing up ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start nothing, won‚Äôt be nothing‚Äù. Had Hamas never attacked Israel on October 7th, thousands of people would still be alive today. 

Now that Israel is DEFENDING themselves people have something to say. Not only am I for eliminated all aggressors from this situation I‚Äôm also pro eliminator of pedophiles. There‚Äôs a bunch of evil in this world and the only way to keep the good people safe is to get rid of the filth that‚Äôs walking amongst us. 

Israel attempted to be diplomatic by pulling their militaries out of certain pockets in the region like Gaza, West Bank, etc. Israel currently has many Muslims/Palestinians living amongst them in their territories, and Israel even has elected officials within their own government from the other side. 

They have done everything humanly possible to resolve this conflict in a civil matter and it‚Äôs constantly being thrown back in their faces. Even Egypt refuses to allow refugees from entering their country because they know the hate that overflows in Gaza and the West Bank. They‚Äôre not ignorant enough to put their people in jeopardy. 

No matter what you say I 100% stand by my statement and hopefully it comes to fruition so future generations will understand in order to eliminate evil in the world, you need to cut the entire cancer out from the roots. 

By doing the dirty work now and being proactive, they will save countless lives in the future. That is a risk that any sane person should be willing to take. I hope that Israel is able to complete this task with minimal lives lost and every evil person who loses their life in this war burns for eternity."
k6yxmwq,I guess they stopped justifying the destruction of whole blocks just to allegedly kill one guy. Now they‚Äôre just levelling whole blocks because they can.
k6yxmd1,"Gaza is not a country. It is a territory under the jurisdiction of Israel, hence the term ""occupied."" Given Hamas's  activities, Israel saw it necessary to take over supplies coming, including water and electricity.

However, this did not stop Hamas from stockpiling an insane amount of weapons. Israel has bombed what, most of northern Gaza, Hamas still hasnt released the hostages. Israel stopped water, food, fuel, and electricity. Hamas still isnt releasing the hostages.

These tatics aren't working with Hamas, so just give the people back the water and electricity. International law dictates this because even in war, we can't forget our humanity. 

And I know Hamas has no humanity. They have proven they dont care for anyone. Gaza is paying dearly for letting them take control in 2006."
k6yxlfz,"You call me a racist, while you sound like one. This is my red line, I don‚Äôt exchange with extremists. Thanks for nothing"
k6yxlc2,"Well, yeah: It‚Äôs clear those governments don‚Äôt care much about the Palestinian people, and it‚Äôs been clear for decades.

I‚Äôve seen some argue the position that their opposition to taking refugees is based on either the belief that it‚Äôs Palestinian land, so they shouldn‚Äôt *have to* leave or the fear that those refugees wouldn‚Äôt be allowed back (or both).

And maybe that‚Äôs a motivation for citizens‚Äô opposition, but I very much doubt that it‚Äôs any of their governments‚Äô reasoning: Seems much more likely that they want to leave Palestinians in the OPT because dealing with the Palestinians diverts Israeli resources which might otherwise be invested in ways that make Israel even more of a regional power."

k6yxg7p,"After going through this thread, I‚Äôm actually lost for words at the logic and mentality of these people, and how brainwashed and so misinformed. 

1) You‚Äôre forgetting the Palestinians never traveled to where you are to terrorize you. It was the other way around when you went to Palestine. (hence you see a lot of videos of Jews screaming ‚Äúanother Nakba‚Äù, calling for the genocide of Arabs. They know their history, yet they‚Äôre okay with it.

2) What do you think comes out of 75 years of oppression? Arabs have been called terrorists for decades even though America has been terrorizing the Middle East. You calling them terrorists doesn‚Äôt faze them 

3) Palestinians tried to peacefully protest in 2018. How did that turn out? Israel has a full genocide agenda, they see even little Palestinian babies as future terrorists and they have bombed over 1000 babies so far, yet they have to make up 40 baby beheaded story. 

4) If you look at history, supporting Israel is like supporting a terrorist group, yet they‚Äôll turn around and call Hamas a terrorist. Israelis killing Rabin for signing peace with Arafat. (Their old prime minister but a right wing nut fan assassinated him incited by Ben netencunt). Collective punishment, used by terrorist organizations (terrorize the public for political gain) for those that don‚Äôt know what terrorist actually means, you just like to toss it around. The mutilation and forced contraceptive of black females in Israel. They are very openly racist in Israel it‚Äôs an all white Jewish state. 

I can go going and can continue listing for hours what Israel is like. It‚Äôs a terrorist state supported by the western world, just like Al-Queda and ISIS. America funded them to topple leaders in the Middle East and it came back to bite them. Bibi funded Hamas to topple Arafat and now Hamas is a terrorist. Ya‚Äôll have done this too many times for it to work, can‚Äôt keep using the same old play book.

4) America clearly looks like an aggressor and even though there‚Äôs so many misinformed people who only watch fox and cnn, in reality Israel is losing the propaganda war and we are losing our credibility."

I also love how you justify current oppression and apartheid happening right now with imagined crimes you think would happen if Palestinians ruled over all of israel. 

It's basically saying you killed someone because you think they'd do the same to you if they had the chance. You gotta look at the current reality, and the current reality is Palestinians being brutalized by the occupation and apartheid state of israel.

The violence inflicted upon them since 47 every day is precisely what brews radicalism and resentment that lead to violence"
k6yx27a,"How do? Since 2005 Israel is not involved in Gaza administratively whatsoever. Hamas is, they are in charge of the Gazan population. Any action in Gaza by the IdF has been in response to the hundreds of thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately at Israel, from behind Palestinian human shields. 

If you cannot see that Hamas is 100% to blame for the status quo in Gaza, you should educate yourself a bit more."
k6yx22l,"&gt; why don't we ever see these videos

I'm guessing you have your eyes closed. 

I'm not exactly sure what you are denying (body cams? Deaths of civilians?). You'd have to be deliberately blind not to see the video of Shani Louk being dragged around. No, she's not alive. 

Here is a less gory proof of body cam: 

https://twitter.com/Versati51739827/status/1711492793665785889

If you want to see the videos of people actually getting shot from terrorist POV, you need to go on telegram. 

Sections of the livestream of Gali Idan's family are available and graphic. At one point they made a teenage boy walk around to the other houses and tell the people to come out. I specifically remember seeing someone getting shot from a bodycam POV in that one. 

I assume that you are just going to deny it because I haven't done the work to link you to the specific video (which I assume you would also find a way to deny) because you are desperately clinging to some worldview of...what...Hamas are gentle kind souls who would never hurt Israeli civilians? Barf. But the evidence is out there if you ever feel like freeing yourself from propaganda."
k6yx1vp,"&gt;surprised how low the death toll is

That's because is underreported. Dead people are accounted only if they are carried to an hospital and people identified them, that number isn't accounting for the people trapped under the rubble or that simple isn't enough left to identify. After all of this is over and international organization can do their work the number will grow."

I'm sick of people that only believe what they want to believe and discount what they don't want to believe. Guess it's just easier to listen to their favorite talking heads and trust them instead of using deductive reasoning to reveal the harder truths to swallow. The fact is, there are many sick groups of people in the world that cause a great many innocent people to face the consequences.

Just today Israel ordered people to evacuate Al-Quds hospital so they can bomb it. Does that mean they care about civilians? Do they care about the kids and people in ICU recovering from being bombed somewhere else? Bombing hospitals is a war crime. ""But it contains a military target."" For which we have no evidence and even if it did, what kind of monster bombs a hospital under any circumstances? If Hamas is underneath it, then find a way to breach the tunnels and go underneath.

k6ywqdb,They are PEOPLE. What are WE doing?
k6ywq9o,"&gt; I mean they are not serious people in regards to making peace.

Certainly compared to the left, Likud considered peace a much lower priority.  They disliked Oslo... Netanyahu made running against it the centerpiece of his 1990s campaign, and certainly undermined it in office. Given that even Labor couldn't get to a workable Oslo type deal Likud had no chance.  

As an aside, it would have been much better for the Palestinians had Abbas worked with Kerry rather than letting the idea settle in that Abbas wasn't serious about peace, but we are discussing Likud not the PA. 

That being said  I think Netanyahu's Economic Peace was vastly more serious than the 2SS negotiations.  Economic Peace was something that could get through the Knesset what the Palestinians were asking for was not. Further Economic Peace is a win-win situation.  It avoids the problem of ""what can the Palestinians possible give worth all of X,Y,Z"".  It also ducks the problem of history. 

&gt; Besides, they are contradicting themselves when they talk about 'good neighborliness'.

I think they mean it more literally.  Jews and Palestinians living as neighbors in peace.

&gt; Likud certainly is incapable of proposing or implementing any form of remotely good-faith attempt at a 1ss that has a chance of working.

I partially agree.  Israel has a serious problem in that the Israeli left. They want a Jewish nationality being overwhelming in Israel where the nationality is determined by race.  Making Jews into a race not a nationality is a betrayal of Zionism.  But in any case the Israeli left was highly influenced by European attitudes towards Arabs. 

 The Israeli right traditionally was much less racist.  They tended to view their situation with the Palestinians as situational not racial.  Jabotinsky's Iron Wall on the one hand is harsh but on the other thinks of Palestinians as equal people who just happen to be the enemy.  Peace with Arabs will be achieved the same way France and Germany have peace, when they have a confluence not a conflict of interests.  FWIW I agree strongly with the traditional Israeli right.

Under Netanyahu and to some extent before that the Israeli Right became Populist.  In many ways it has blurred the the two so now quite often Palestinians are enemies because of their racial conflicts of interest.  Obviously that's a doctrine that is both morally objectionable and makes peace impossible.   Netanyahu ends up talking out of both sides of his mouth sometimes sounding like a member of the KKK and sometimes sounding more like Reagan's vision for a warm peace with the future Russia once the Soviet Union falls. I'm optomistic enough to believe the real Netanyahu in his heart believes in his own Economic Peace, and the racist appeals are immoral election opportunism.  But at the same time behavior changes belief, it is possible the Netanyahu of 15 years ago was a different man than the one of today. 

So my TL:DR version is that Likud's platform is a serious peace platform were it run by the Likud of the 1980s.  Under the Likud of the 2020s it isn't.  But the Likud of the 2020s isn't serious in a whole lot of ways peace just being an important example."
k6ywq4a,"To answer your question as to why you hear about it.
Israel spends a lot in self promotion to protect itself from the threat of larger Arab nations, in response to this self promotion palestinians self promote and put down Israel with false claims of genocide. This makes this conflict more visible than any other, even the Russia Ukraine one.

There was not even Islam and Christians that time too. 

&gt;¬´¬†Promised land¬†¬ªis backed by no international laws unfortunately for Israel.

And Israeli ancestors who processed that are Jews. So? Now that new generation converted to other religions or become atheist, you think it will now become void? Lol

&gt;they can live in their homeland in peace with anyone who identifies as a Saudi.

Same as the Israeli. And fyi Palestine is TERRORIST STATE with zero contributions on Earth but terorrism. Stop being a racist to Israeli and move on. Dont be jealous they become a great nation with great scientists and invention and highly developed the desert. That's why UAEA acknowledge Israel because they're both all started from a desert now highly developed. Meanwhile the Palestine. . . . . ."

At the same time it also doesn‚Äôt mean that they are targeting civilians 100% of the time. But that does bring me to a few valid questions - they say they have been targeting residential buildings, schools, and hospitals because they are trying to get to the underground tunnels, although those tunnels seem pretty unaffected by the airstrikes‚Ä¶why do they keep doing it? And if the hostages are supposedly inside the tunnels‚Ä¶? I also wonder why they keep targeting journalists‚Ä¶seems like the oldest trick in the propaganda playbook - eliminate any source of truth. 

Dude don‚Äôt show me sh!t of ‚Äúpeople celebrating‚Äù. I truly could not give less of a fuk. If you were living under military siege and had experienced intense Israeli bombardment not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4 but 5 TIMES over the span of less than 20 years, I‚Äôm pretty sure you would celebrate too. 

I‚Äôm talking about the people in the first innocent civilians video you linked and not the second. Obviously anyone directly involved in the second are not innocent but they are also not the people in question (bystanders are still innocent though).

But the first? If showing a sense of relief in response to your oppressor getting a taste of his own medicine (as any HUMAN would) makes you ‚Äúnot innocent‚Äù then what about Israeli complicity in maintaining and perpetuating an apartheid state? What about IDF soldiers who have committed crimes against Palestinians when Hamas is not involved? Oh and Israeli settlers in the West Bank then are DEFINITELY not innocent in that case‚Ä¶.

I have videos of people chanting death to Arabs and TikTok upon TikTok of Israelis mocking the suffering of Gazans. So I guess they‚Äôre also not innocent?

k6ywm5k,And you got the answer. Hamas is not good for Gazans but Israeli government is also the same. You can see what the Israeli government is doing to Palestinians in West Bank. Some would say it‚Äôs a lot worse than being under Hamas . They are just choosing lesser of 2 evils. They don‚Äôt seem to have a better option . What do you think Israeli government would treat gazans like their citizens? Hamas was created and funded by Israeli government so you can see what options gazans have

Azerbaijan made a deal with Israel in 2006 to sell oil to them and planned the building of a pipeline that would go through Turkey due to Ceyhan port. Azeris offered a partnership to Turkey and they accepted. It belongs to Azeris, they can cut it off not us. We already froze our own independent energy and gas projects with Israel this week."
k6ywlcv,Hamas was calling for ceasefire a day or two after attack. These idiots don't realize that the ROE has changed and they also under estimated that people that formerly took their word at face value now have questions. 5k dead? Really? Is that like the 500 dead in the hospital you bombed?

k6ywj01,"As I said, the people who were massacred in 7/10 were not casualties, they were butchered and that massacre is the reason for the war. Nothing in the history of this conflict gives anyone (in either side) the reason or legitimacy to massacre innocent civilians for the sake of murdering civilians.

You mentioned the settlers in the west bank. I can tell you that the illegal settlements are quite controversial in Israel. While the government isn't really actively against them, they don't really actively support them either. That is also controversial. There are lots of cases of massacres of Palestinian which is of course bad and in most cases I can recall, the perpetrators went to trial.

Right now, calling for a cease fire and Palestinian aid, is supporting only Hammas, not the people of Gaza.
Hammas takes all of the supplies, funding and uses the Palestinians as human shields."

Kings 15:16

At that time Menahem sacked Tiphsah and all who were in it and its territory from Tirzah on, because they did not open it to him. Therefore he sacked it, and he ripped open all the women in it who were pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

Isaiah 13:16

Their infants will be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished.

&amp;#x200B;

Psalm 137:9

Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones and dashes them against the rock!

&amp;#x200B;

Samuel 15:3

Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.

Hosea 13:16

Samaria shall bear her guilt, because she has rebelled against her God; they shall fall by the sword; their little ones shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women ripped open."

He's purposely being vague so people like you can claim he's just referring to Hamas when in reality he's referring to anyone who supports Palestine. On top of that, Israel lies as well so why should we believe them over Hamas? What has Israel done to prove they are truthful? They lied when they killed Shireen. They lie when they say there's isn't apartheid in the West Bank when it is obvious to anyone that the Palestinians are treated like second class citizens. They lie when they say they dont target medics and journalists. Even right now settlers are killing Palestinians under IDF protection in the West Bank and threatening to kill more Palestinians.

Then we need to take a look at history, i.e. 9/11, and understand what we achieved by invading Iraq and Afghanistan (spoiler alert, many of our soldiers died and the Taliban are back). 

Terrorists are like mould, you cant eradicate mould if you‚Äôre giving it the conditions to thrive.

If you think you can eradicate Hamas by completely leveling Gaza, you are wrong. They will come back stronger in a few decades, probably from Iran and Qatar, and once again pose a security threat to Israel.

Stealing what? A land given to us? Unused by anyone?

&gt; thousands of Palestinians are being massacred 

What of it? They support ethnic cleansing. The chant ""From the river to the sea"" is sung there like a children's song. The civilians were the ones who sold information to Hamas for their assault.

&gt; ""Nazi"" and ""Jews"" to ""Israel"" and ""Palestinians"". 

I don't think you get it, there is no Palestine. There is an annoying misconception that Palestine was a state, it wasn't. There are documentations showing how it was just a bunch of Jews, Arabs, and Christians around the country, usually Jews were the minority in the land, but either way, it was mostly fine, excluding the recurring manslaughter against Jews by extremists.  
So say that it was injustice or unlawful all you want, but what's better, a land unruled with a house of innocents being murdered every now and then, which you won't hear about because no one would cover it, or a land lead in democracy (not the greatest government, I'd admit, but still something), unlike Hamas, which leads in hate and terrorism.  


TL:DR   
Wanna support your so called ""Palestinians""? Support taking out Hamas, they're the enemy, both for Israeli citizens, and Gazans. They committed the mass shootings, they raped and burned innocents. They ARE animals, and will be treated as such.  
But the moment a civilian from the Gaza strip supports them, acts on their behalf, you can't speak against it, as it is, by definition, an act of terrorism."

k6yv8pd,"&gt;It‚Äôs not hate speech,

It absolutely is.

&gt;So what happens? Israel eliminates all of Hamas and 20 years from now their spawns are now fighting age and want revenge from their fathers being killed because their fathers went on a killing spree starting the entire issue. So Israel will then again lose thousands of lives and the cycle never continues?

An inconvenience for Isreal doesn't justify genocide.

&gt;THOUSANDS OF THEM

Even if it was ""thousands"" it is still false generalization.



&gt;If you owned a farm and continuously had your chickens killed by a pack of coyotes. You catch one of the coyotes in action and eliminate it. A few weeks later more of your chickens turn up dead. Are you going to to take out another coyote or are you going to take out the entire pack? 

Really ? Now you are comparing them to animals and drawing the same conclusion as you would with animals. 

I've had it with your racist warmongering. This conversation is over."
k6yv7nk,Damn the press AND the Red Crescent were conspicuously on standby AS this was being recorded by someone in the distance. How conspicuous.

k6yv4jz,"Nope Im still very critical about Saudi Arabia and Iran. And their role in this.

Why aren't more people reporting about this. This is a good question.

I think it's because the Muslim world is kind of torn between people who support Iran and people who support Saudi Arabia and since those two control alot of Arab media, this issue is kind of devided.

With Israel their is a clear bad guy and most Arabs can agree on that. That's why Israel will get more criticism then Saudi Arabia. This goes also for other conflicts like Syria, where the Arab world is kind of divided."

This is the number of palastenias killed by IDF and armed settlers in WB. When you do this to peaceful un armed farmers, do you think anybody would convinced that ""if you don't arm you will be ok""

No thanks, I will fight back and die in the process since I will die anyways!

I think I would stand with the right side of history, even when it's weaker. Because the boys that Israel just cut the water off for the past 2 weeks are going to give israel hell in the future .. same as those hamas fighters who are originally from refugee camps of the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians."
k6yv3fb,When? It‚Äôs been happening for many decades and even happening now. Have a look at West Bank. There‚Äôs no Hamas there but Israel sends idf to help settlers steal houses and torture rape and kill Palestinians there . You just need to open your eyes üëÄ
k6yv2wx,Tell Tal Hanna (Jorge) a thing or two about all this brainwashing
k6yv1xz,"This is simply false
I think Israel wants to live in peace
I have a hard time finding a time when israel initiated a war just for the sake of it.
Also, throughout the short 75 years of existence, it has made so many compromises regarding its land (sinai, gaza, south lebanon, oslo accords, y accords) its pretty clear it is not interested in expanding and willing to reach agreements if they can lead to it's safety.

And about the ethnic cleansing part of what you said, also quite a pathetic comment on you side.
There are millions of arab citizens who live in israel and are a part of the country. Most of these arabs are not ethnically different from the Palestinians in gaza or the west bank.

Also israel has proven to take so many actions that are meant to minimize the killing of cevellians. Things such as notifying danger bombs, making phone calls, dropping pamphlets and throwing little warning bombs before the actual attacks (this is called ""knock on the door"". These are things no other army does, let alone one that is interested in genocide.

If you want to talk about genocide i think you should first read the hamas charter and watch the footage from the terrorists helmets..."
k6yv1tm,"The ethnic cleansing of Armenians breaks my heart. I am not Armenian, so I cannot speak on their behalf but if you are Armenian please, I urge all Armenians to speak up and post about what‚Äôs going on!!"
k6yv1o2,"You know what I find truly dishonest about the pro-Israeli movement? While the pro-palestinians have no problem acknowledging Hamas' wrong and actions, going even beyond by saying they don't support it and condemn such actions, Pro-Israeli, on the other hand, are so blinded by their thirst for supremacy and power that they completely forget about the actions of the IDF and Israeli governement for the past 75 years. You cannot sit there and continue to defend your governement when they have committed 77+ war crimes according to UN and international laws. When Palestinians are restricted in their movement and have no independence, no privacy and no Freedom. You all are the truly blinded ones. So much for the ""chosen people of God"".

Hamas wasn't there before 87, yet the killing of civilians happened since the beginning. But anyways, you're gonna tell me that before that there was such, and after there will be such. So convenient for Israeli to have an enemy to fight off everytime. Just like it was so convenient to kill the jews during wwii because they were deemed the enemy by the same means of propaganda that Israel is doing right now. 

Riddle me this then, why are people in Israel protesting against the actions of the governement, why are jews all around the world protesting in support of the Palestinians? Are they brainwashed too? Are the 120 countries that voted yes for a ceasefire deluded? 

Is it normal for the US to put their veto for an issue that doesn't concern them? Oh yeah right, it does concern them... Wanting power, petrol and money is more important than human lives I guess...
 

And yes I can tell you that these 7000 deaths are civilians. Go check the official 212 pages document the palestinians authority (PA) has just released. Names of all the victims with age and sex. More than half of them are children. You're gonna tell me now that new-born babies and 5 years Olds are terrorist or Hamas?! Are you this serious? Whatever I say, goes in one hear and exits the other. You're probably gonna tell me this document is false also. 

For the CTV cameras, they are pointed into the Palestinaians house. It's an infringement of private life. Checkpoints, infringement of liberty of movement. But I gues it's normal for you, for a 2million + people to be encircled and trapped in a human case with no control of their water and electricity supply. 

Btw you drew a comparison with Bin laden. Are you seriously comparing Bin laden and his militants to civilians ?! And anyways when they killed Bin laden they avoided civilian casualties, something the IDF should take as an example since they can't even aim properly and hit Egypt. Oh but that's fine cause it was a mistake and civilians are used as human shields. 

You say the jews are indeginous to the land, go read and not the ones written by Israeli authorities or media. An indeginous people means that they are the EARLIEST civilization to the land. The land of Canaan, where Canaanites, Amorites, Assyrians, Hamites and Arabs were present before the jews. For them to claim they are indeginous, means that when jews arrived no one was previously there. Even with the story of Moses peace be upon him. He took the enslaved jews out of Egypt to move to Canaan, a promised land of God according to them. How can they move to a place they are already supposed to be there. You're gonna tell me about the fact that there were jews 3000 years ago. well there were peoples before that.  

Regardless of this argument, what is important is that in 48, when holocaust survivors arrived, THERE WERE PEOPLE ALREADY THERE. Palestinians with passeports, with land of their ancestors that were them displaced during the 1948 war. 

Check yourself in the mirror. According to you collective punishment is the solution and civilians should just continue to die without proper care. Great to see your morals.

For the genitals and rape, ex Israeli soldier have testified. Check tantura film by alon Schwarz. You can find bits of videos everywhere on YouTube."

k6yuzop,Now we can watch this story get buried
k6yuyby,Yea this normal
k6yuxz5,"I'll start by saying this story is really not relevant to the Gaza situation.

This was on a Mediterranean cruise, mostly in Greece, but with one stop in Turkey. I was traveling with a friend who suffered a ruptured ovarian cyst, resulting in life-threatening blood loss. A Turkish hospital surgically intervened to close it and remove 1.5L (3 pints) of blood from her abdomen.

Within 30 minutes of the anesthesia wearing off, a hospital administrator came to her room and demanded $40,000 immediately. Of course she doesn‚Äôt have that readily available. This man would proceed to show up to her room every hour and demand payment from her, telling her to call anyone she knows (note: due to the time zones, Americans hadn't woken up yet that morning).

On day 2, he continues to show up to her room every hour. He informs her that they will physically stop her from leaving the hospital until she pays. They do not work with American insurance, and they do not accept payment plans. That's when I found [this article](https://travelnoire.com/couple-say-they-cant-leave-turkey-until-they-pay-18000-medical-bill), shockingly similar to our own story, and realized that we were functionally in a hostage situation; either we pay money or my friend is indefinitely detained with no legal recourse.

My friend called the consulate, and basically, their response was, ""well what's your plan?"" They don't really have any assistance to offer. They cannot intervene in this extralegal detention, nor advocate for her in any way.

This story ends up less dramatic because on day 3 we found someone with the means to pay the bill.

As I mentioned, not a close story to the Americans currently in Gaza. But it was eye-opening to learn that if you're fucked, the state department will do nearly nothing to unfuck you unless it's specifically a passport/visa issue."

Only calling out the negative things that hamas has done and acting like israel didn't do anything wrong because they didn't do those specific things you said.

k6yur3f,"Hamas steals hundreds of millions in humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people to line their pockets and buy rockets.

Gaza was a beautiful place that could have been an economic powerhouse that was ruined once it was given over to these terrorists. These Palestinians could have had thriving lives in that beautiful piece of land, but the bitterness of Hamas toward their Jewish neighbors diverted the goal from having a good existence in the land to trying to wipe out Jews, even if it resulted in the deaths of their own people.

How are you going to honestly say that Hamas is  fighting for the rights of their people when they use their people as human shields and deprive them of the water and electricity that they need?"
k6yuqqe,"&gt; Even post launch, they know where the rockets are coming from.

They launch from very densely populated areas, next to schools, mosques, hospitals (as we saw last week) etc.  Then they pack up their shoe-string operation and leave while the rockets are still in the air.

So air strikes take too long to scramble, and automatic/indiscriminate counter-battery fire (e.g. via a radar + artillery system) would quickly be condemned due to the massive amounts of civilian casualties.  &lt;---- which, let's be frank, is the entire goal of Hamas here.  They are using the Palestinian civilians as meat shields and everyone (including the Palestinians) are conveniently ignoring this particular war crime because it ""kills j00s too!"""
k6yuqqr,"If they are holding them against their will, then those estimated 600 American citizens in Gaza are also hostages of Hamas."
k6yuqjg,A good example of infantry losing it is the WW2 blunder that was retaking Attu island from the Japanese. No garrison was left so all casualties were inflicted by traps and friendly fire.
k6yuqhl,"This is plausible, everyone is thinking that it was either completely mindless, or that they intended to pull a Gavrilo Princip and plunge all the region into war on purpose 

Their business with Israel was pretty much ritualistic at this point, perform a token act of ‚Äúresistance‚Äù, create some more victims and misery on their own people, claim them as martyrs to earn sympathy and maintain relevance 

They probably wanted a bolder and bigger  version of this, with their other Iranian-backed allies causing a ruckus, instead of succeeding in making huge massacre that would force Israel into invasion"

‚ÄúWe call out to all leaders in the world.
Never again.

Jews will never allow the existence of a new Nazi state.

Anyone who supports the state of Israel and Zionism is an enemy of Judaism and Jews.

Zionists are the enemies of Judaism and are today's Nazis and war criminals.

One day, Zionists, just like the Nazis, will definitely be held accountable for the genocides and crimes they committed before humanity. When that day comes, the enemies of Jews and Judaism will be tried together with those who support Zionism.

It is not too late, stop supporting Zionism, the enemy of humanity, immediately.‚Äù"
k6yug3z,"Civilians were parading corpses in the streets, singing, and dancing along with Hamas. Until they stand up and elect a real government and stop lobbing rockets into Israel on a daily basis, they are complicit.  Hamas needs eradicated, period."

May jews, muslims, Christians and every innocent civilian live in peace. Fuck the state. You growing your hate on ""arabs"" will not solve the problem."
k6yuerf,"There are documentaries on the tunnels online, reporters have been able to get guided tours by Hamas themselves.

People arent denying the existance of the tunnels, theyre questioning Israels intelligence when they bomb tunnels without providing evidence. There are plenty of times they have bombed civilian infrastructure leading to civilian casualties and not providing proof that it was a legitimate target. Its gets even more complicated when they have in the past classed  Palestinian Human Rights organisations as Terrorist Organizations.

[Al Haq is an example of these, it was classified as a terrorist organisation in 2021 without evidence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Haq#)

There are ofcourse other High Profile cases of Israel killing civilians without just cause, Shireen Abu Akleh is one of the more famous ones, but they bomb schools and hospitals on the regular and will just claim that Hamas was there, theyre everywhere according to the government. Its a catch all to protect them from backlash. Noone is saying that 100% of the bombings are unjustified either, there are going to be bombs dropped on legitimate targets and these cases will be used as ""proof"" that all of the bombings are justified. Its not disimilar from the US classing all adult men as terrorists in Iraq or Afghanistan. It does not make them legitimate targets."
k6yue9x,Good to hear from the PFLP
k6yudpg,In the Old Testament Iran was a hero to the Jews. Iran liberated the Jews from Babylon and helped them rebuild the temple. Iran being an enemy of Israel is really a pretty new twist to the story.
k6yud8v,I think that's /r/worldnews
k6yud39,They love to rip on Israel publicly since they're such an easy scapegoat/distraction for all their corruption and internal problems but I think they are well aware that the actual weakening or collapse of Israel would have dire consequences on their own hold on power. Millions of Palestinian refugees who may heavily sympathize with Islamist/Islamic Fundamentalist groups fleeing to neighboring countries in the event of power vacuum would simply mean chaos and instability for years to come. It could easily embolden ISIS style groups to rebel against the corrupt governments in places like Jordan and Egypt which could easily lead to civil war in an attempt to establish some extremist caliphate like we saw a decade ago in Syria and Iraq.

They've been demanding Palestinians to evacuate south, while heavily bombing northern Gaza from the air and although the Northern part is obviously not empty of civilians, they've been trying to enter Gaza by ground since Friday night.

Forcing them to stay and a certain mental state for pretty much their entire lives. 

This is a perfect example of someone never being told that they are wrong in life. So no matter what happens, you will always be the enemy for calling them out."

k6yu49z,oh shit thanks for telling me
k6yu4ar,It‚Äôs honestly too early to tell. The start of ground ops into an urban environment was never going to kick off with a massive blitzkrieg style assault.   These are probably still shaping operations.
k6yu3mq,"Hamas rose to power in 2006. Nethanyahu propped them up in a speegh in 2019. He's a scumbag, but he didn't have anything to do with Hamas rise.

k6yu2cm,The table spanned from Moscow to Gaza
k6yu1bm,"Sigh- I am beginning to think there is just a bunch of bots coming up with flailed arguments and strawman arguments to start fights.  Frankly- I didn‚Äôt have sympathy for Hamas before but you keep this up and people are going to support them just to spite the Israeli supporters  manipulating the bots (tongue in cheek &amp; exaggeration for effect.)

First-it was not instant backlash. America spent months back and forth with the UN and the government of Afghanistan about them hosting Al-Qaida.  We would have accepted(&amp; did demand) that the government of Afghanistan turn over all of the leadership and others who were part of Al-Qaida.  They were given the option and they chose to defend the terrorists.  I don‚Äôt believe Israel ever contacted Hamas‚Äôs diplomats to negotiate a solution to the attack‚Äîand I am being sarcastic here because that gets into the other factual error which makes this argument a fallacy.  

Israel spent over 50 years preventing Gaza/Palestine from being a self-governing and legit government.  Before 2005, they never tried to help them establish leadership, a military, invest in infrastructure (BTW-all things the US did during the war)

To be blunt- Israel is like that parent who had an unruly child and throughout their pre-adolescence they attempt to beat the kid into submission THEN the kid hits the late teen years and they throw their hands up and say ‚Äúyou are society‚Äôs problem now‚Äù refusing any responsibility for what they raised.  THEN the kid turns 18, commits some heinous crime which they must be held accountable for BUT we all recognize the kid never stood a chance because he never was given the chance to develop the necessary social skills, understand other‚Äôs boundaries or problem solve.

I and many others would be much more sympathetic to the parents (&amp; the Israelis) if they spent 15 years helping the kid (Palestine) become a functioning adult who then made a choice to go the wrong way.  And that is what happened in Afghanistan.  They were given the option to discipline and do the right thing in 2001.  They didn‚Äôt.  The  child (al-Qaida) became a bigger, stronger kid and the US went in to prevent a worse threat from growing to adulthood.  We gave them EVERY resource to fix things and the Taliban wasn‚Äôt interested.

NOTE- I know this analogy will go over a lot of heads especially anyone not familiar with child rearing and the terminology I used.  I also know it is highly simplistic but it was meant to make a point about responsibility)"
k6yu13s,"Perhaps they misunderstood how the US military functions and that a leadership crisis wouldn‚Äôt really interfere with a response to a conflict with Israel.  
 
I don‚Äôt think they understood that Israel is so important to conservative voters that the GOP would rush to settle on a leader, so that they could vote on Israeli support quickly."
k6yu05f,They choose not to engage with him. I have seen very few western leftists report on him. Why? Because he is the true representative of the Palestinian people and they have no answer to him. It is true he worked for shin bet but doing so put a big target on his back and he literally risked his life to stop violence. It‚Äôs funny how leftists praise Edward Snowden but ignore this guy who was always in more danger of being killed.
k6ytzxh,Then what the heck you been saying Israel will lose the war? How?
k6ytz1y,$14B is chump change for the US. We would have to provide a couple hundred billion to even start a conversation about how much is too much‚Ä¶ and if we cut all foreign aid in the world we still wouldn‚Äôt have free healthcare.

k6ytz0v,"They can fight and die or they can use their funds to live their lives better with the land they got and give up on their dreams. Not saying that as pro Israel or pro Palestine. Just stating facts since you asked a rhetoric question which is not actually rhetoric.

Choices have prices. Hamas and Palestinians will pay for their choice while Israel will pay for theirs. But eventually, one of those sides will heroically win while the other will lose everything.

My point is - clearly one of the sides is way stronger than the other and the side that is weaker should've reconsidered their aggression because it's going to bite them in the ass. And this I say as a pro Israel."

k6ytyhp,"Came to America from Palestine for better life and here they are bringing all their old world hatred and bs with them. 

Everyone holding a Palestinian flag should go to Gaza and go to Palestine and help free the country there because all they're doing is causing hatred fear and violence on the streets of a host country who allowed them to come in. 

And for any of the American Born they need to read a book and figure out if this is a fight that they want to be in and then just like our Ukrainian friends go there and help don't just walk on the street and yell at other people."
k6ytyd4,"I would, yes. My grandparents did, in fact. That's because everybody surrenders after they lose wars and their country is ""stolen."" This describes every conquest in history. Group A conquers Group B. Group B surrenders. Group A keeps the conquered territory. Everybody moves on

Think of literally any country on Earth. The side that loses the war gives up. The losers never feel like it is ""fair"" to lose territory. But this is the nature of war.

Germany, for instance, lost WWII. They lost territory. They gave up, negotiated their surrender, and moved on with their lives. Millions of Jewish people lost their homes in WWII. That wasn't fair. But Jews have not been fighting for 75 years to get their homes in Germany back. They became refugees and moved to other places. Like every other group of refugees except the Palestinians.

(Also ‚Äî you know that Gaza has not been part of Israel for 75 years, right? It was owned by Egypt until 1967. Since you are Egyptian, I would think you'd know that. So Egyptians stole this Palestinian country too. Why was that not ""unfair""?)"

Nethanyau and his new radical right settler allies tried to undermine several security orgs, including the IDF, to serve their purposes. This made a lot of people, including reservists and soldiers, reluctant to serve under a corrupt government that clearly doesn't serve the interests of Israel."
k6ytvov,mmh? What do you think it's for?
k6ytvfd,Maybe go live in a fascist dictatorship if your snowflake ass can't handle a phone.

k6yttv5,"Currently it is war. 
Israel wants and needs to end Hamas.

Every war has civilians casualties that can't be disputed - the civilian population always suffers, and the most suffering have kids - it's a very, very sad fact.

In a war u have to kill ur Military opponent, otherwise u will not win the war.

Israel has military bases at which Hamas could aim -  which they don't, they just shoot their rockets anywhere without targeting any military - the Hamas charter openly has a Jewish genocide in their charter, so killing civilians is the plan, hence they don't need to ""aim"" at anything - so there is one thing that can't be argued about: 

Hamas wants a genocide, that's their goal - but everyone including u is ignoring that

Israel wants to kill Hamas fighters. 
Hamas has no military bases for Israel to aim at, they hide their bases and rockets within and under houses and hospitals - that is also an undisputed fact.

So what in ur opinion should Israel do? 

Currently they bomb any houses of which they have information on some sort of Hamas base/usage  - considering this is all that they can do to fight Hamas that's and it's as fair a game as it can get when ur opponent uses it's own civilians as a human shield - the latter if which is war crime alone.

Ur argument that Israel is doing a genocide is a direct result of Hamas giving 0 fucks about their own civilians - Israel does to some extent do roof knocking, mass phone calls and flyers dropped from planes.

All of those 3 things is much more of what Hamas is doing to protect the ppl if Gaza

So from facts alone Hamas in responsible for 2 genocide, Israel and their own ppl 

So fir fucks sake explain me why Hamas has 0 ZERO responsibility in that matter?"

k6ytfht,"Palestine had both Muslims and Jews living there. As a two state solution for peace, Palestine was divided into Jordan and Israel. The vast majority of the land was used for Jordan. The tiny sliver used for Israel was where Jews were the majority and had been buying the land for 70 years. There was also state owned uninhabitable desert with nobody living there that was used for Israel.

No land was stolen. The Muslim minority living in the land used for Israel was allowed to stay and given equal rights. Which is why 20% of Israel is Muslim and Muslims are so well represented in Israeli government.

Palestine was never a country. It was an area that belonged to various empires. The only people who had their land stolen were the Jews in Jordan who were kicked out by the Muslims and forced to move to Israel against their will."

The airstrikes are going on so long in order to make it easier for the ground troops. Netanyahu and Gallant yesterday made it clear that casualties of soldiers in invasion will be heavy.

Banners calling for death of Jews should be treated as hate crime incitement and those responsible should be arrested. Antisemitism needs to be called out for being THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL THIS BLOODSHED ON BOTH SIDES. There would be no need for militarized state of Israel if not for the ANTISEMITES. They are Guilty.

Russia-Ukraine is nothing like this conflict‚Ä¶ If Ukrainian terrorists had stormed into Russia and RAPED/murdered civilians, they would justified to retaliate. They didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ If anything, Hamas is Russia in this (dumb) scenario. 

The fact you think this war was manufactured to Israel‚Äôs advantage is just‚Ä¶ Dumb. Do you also believe in the Illuminati? There is no grand conspiracy afoot here bro, no shadow cabal of governments performing false flag operations. Just regular old dirty Islamic terrorists. 

Do you know how much bombs cost? How much war costs? Wages for the 100s of 1000s reservists called into action? Of course Israel is losing money‚Ä¶ War is the most expensive activity possible. 

You are not supporting liberation‚Ä¶ You are supporting terror, whether you know it or not. I can‚Äôt believe Hamas propaganda is this effective. 

Does Gaza look liberated to you? The place is going to be leveled‚Ä¶ There will be a massive minefield to protect the border, effectively reducing their usable land. 

Supporting this violent resistance is not only anti-Israel, it‚Äôs actively supporting Palestinian casualties‚Ä¶ There is no world where Palestine gets ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù through violent resistance.

k6ysa9n,"I've read it...

If Bibi can talk the Czech Nazis and agree to soften their stance on the Holocaust to be more lenient about settlements, we can talk to Hamas and agree to exchange prisoners.

This is just another Milchemet Shlom Bibi (war for Bibi) and let's admit that this is once again that, only this time we're A LOT angrier (for very understandable reasons) and this time he will be in most trouble once it ends... so it will go on for a while.

So Israel will then again lose thousands of lives and the cycle never continues? 

Also it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúfew hundred‚Äù they were literally celebrating in the streets, THOUSANDS OF THEM! These are the same adults that indoctrinate these children at a very young age to hate everything Israel! 

If you owned a farm and continuously had your chickens killed by a pack of coyotes. You catch one of the coyotes in action and eliminate it. A few weeks later more of your chickens turn up dead. Are you going to to take out another coyote or are you going to take out the entire pack? 

There‚Äôs been zero pushback against Hamas from the people of Palestine, ZERO! They do nothing to stop them yet celebrate their actions. 

I don‚Äôt understand how people like you just expect innocent people to continue being murdered because one of the 100 people doing the murdering is a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù. Why don‚Äôt you pack your bags, move to Israel, and in 10 years we will reconnect and you can‚Äôt tell me how good they are."

How many of you dual citizens Israelis would give up your American passport for your Israeli passport today? Probably one

Dual citizenship should be banned in Israel, or at least for politicians. How can you have leaders and politicians who are citizens of Israel and simultaneous citizens of the US? Conflict of interests much? Whose interests are they acting in? U.S. or Israel? It seems to be tipping more and more in favour of the US. 

The US doesn't want peace or stability in the region and neither does their puppet Bibi. Isn't it weird how the Americans are so die-hard about the MOST HATED politicians in Israeli history? Its because that warmonger Bibi is an American puppet who feeds the American war machine. None of them want peace, but I know the people of Israel do.

Israel is a Western US puppet country in the global South, until they begin to integrate they will never be accepted in the region."
k6yrtst,"Lol, it's very telling how much you talk about yourself. This is an ego thing to you. You are not seeking truth. You are seeking control and power. Bud, reddit is the last place where you will find control and power, especially when you try to gain it through games and ignorance. 

You think somebody professing or speaking on a stage is performative. What's performative is forcing somebody to do or say something so they feel like they fit in or are accepted. By your definition, every teacher, religious spiritual leader, and presenter is committing a performative action.

This guy does not speak about rejecting anyone, he does not tell them to go and demand people to make statements. He does not tell them to try and control another person. For this man to be making a performative action, he must try to force somebody in a situation based on disingenuous intent. 

Look, English may not be your first language. You may be translating this wrong. In English, a performative action is like telling somebody if they don't come to your party they are not your friend. Or in the workplace, people engage with extracurricular engagement in order to get more promotions."
k6yrtf9,"The reason is simple terrifyingly simple this is War. An actual war, not a anti terrorism campaign. Gaza is a highly populated area and not a lot of places for Civilians to flee the fighting to. Egypt, Jordan and Israel are very reluctant rightly so to take in refugees do to the extremely high likelihood of Hamas fighters using it to cross the boarders to commit more attacks on civilians in Israel and attacks on Jewish people and Synagogues in Egypt and Jordan causing Civil unrest. Even with high prision weapons and good intelligence gathering this will still happen. The most recent and relivent example is the first gulf War that killed  estimated 100,000 to 200,000 and injured up to 1 million. 
Unfortunately the reality  of a war. This should be a relatively short conflict, but because of location and lack of any where for the people to flee to it will be bloody."

Even when it comes to the development of medicine, it is usually aimed at illnesses mainly affecting people from well-off countries even when focus on illnesses affecting people from poorer countries could save many, many more lives at a much cheaper cost.

The problem of disproportionate exposure of different conflicts and disproportionate sympathy for different groups is an unfortunately fact which is likely at least partly rooted in basic group psychological mechanisms."

The REAL cowards are those who can only attack unarmed innocent civillians but scared to IDF, tell the Palestines terrorist to face IDF now toe to toe. Why they are HIDING and RUNNING?

&gt; Saturday's assault, the worst breach in Israel's defences since Arab armies waged war in 1973, followed two years of subterfuge by Hamas that involved keeping its military plans under wraps and convincing Israel it did not want a fight.

&gt; While Israel was led to believe it was containing a war-weary Hamas by providing economic incentives to Gazan workers, the group's fighters were being trained and drilled, often in plain sight, a source close to Hamas said.

When Israel left Gaza, there were *no* restrictions on Gaza.
Not only that, Israel continuously provided water, electricity, fuel, money and medical supplies.
Only once NaziHamas ( who, I remind you, is openly Nazi) took hold on Gaza, and only after they kidnapped an Israeli soldier, Israel started.teh blockade.

2. No, the world is not backing Israel. Look at you, for example. Where is your integrity? At least you can admit that Israel did try to achieve some resolution. 

3. Again, wrong. The reason for this war is not to return the hostages. It is certainly one of it goals, but not the first one.
The first goal is to eradicate NaziHamas organisation. It is the only way for peace. In can you were not aware of it, Israel already made an exchange of prisoners deal with NaziHamas, and freed ~1000 terrorists. Guess what? The leaders of the Oct 7th pogrom are those released prisoners.
The point of the war is to remove this evil from the face of the earth, and to ensure it will no happen again.

4. If you truly understand me, than please try to understand the following - we, the Jews, have no other home. The Arabs, from even before WW2, attacked us Jews, in similar manner the Oct 10th pogrom.  We wish having peace with the Palestinians and put this stupid land dispute behind us for a better future for the world. We are even willing to give up land to get this peace, as we did in Habron, Jenin, Gaza.
I can assure you, if Gaza would have been a success, that could have lead to peace across the world. But, on every occasion, the Palestinians chose war and hatred over peace and prosperity. The outcome of the Oct 10th pogrom is that there will be no peace for the next 100 years. And that Israel doesn't have a choice - it must remove NaziHamas from the face of the earth.

5. I am sorry, you do not fully understand what holocaust is.
What is happening in Gaza is a war. Like there was a war against the Nazis in WW2. They also had civilians casualties., by the Allies forces. The US nuked the Japanese twice(!!). This is a war. An ugly war. A war that could have been avoided if NaziHamas would not launch the Oct 7th pogrom. 

6. I read Chomsky. He is an Idiot, and would not survive the world he is preaching for.
He spoke about ""what would the world choose if they had a chance"".
The awful truth is that if you ask all of the world, the majority would vote for the annihilation of the Jews. It does not mean I should go as a lamb to the butcher.

7. I am a Zionist Jew. Israel is my only home. I have nowhere to go. I will fight till the end."

I think many leftists like yourself view the situation as follows: ""The palestinian people do not support hamas, they are a peace loving, progressive people, just like anyone in the West. They just want to be free, have a free economy, give their people the freedom to express their religion, thoughts, sexual preferences, etc as they please.

k6yq3hn,Hmmm the country that hosts the Hamas leaders ? Something seems off there
k6yq345,"&gt;it was only due to the first intifada that they were confined to the Gaza Strip.

Everybody knows that before the Oslo accords , the  borders of  former Palestine (Eretz Yisarel , if you are touchy )  were reunited since 1948  after 1967 , but that's hardly relevant .  Only a minority of Palestinians travelled beyond thier areas , and the situation was mostly a continuation of pre-1967 being a military occupation ; the only differences is that Israeli-Jews as the occupying power  were better in some ways (freer media , better mobility as you said etc .) , and worse in others ( Human right abuses , a worse  economy etc ) .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the Gaza Strip was captured in a defensive war.

""Defensive"" as justification for perpetual occupation is just an Israeli-national myth .  

There was no need for an occupation in the West Bank as an example ; every one at the time knew the Hashemites had  no interest in actively invading Israel  , and instead only retired themselves to launching rockets for the sake of preserving their reputation in Arab politics .

Gaza was once occupied in 1956   ; Israeli-Jews left it within 2 years  , and not stay for half a century .

Should the Vietnamese occupied Cambodia for 20 years ?  , Should the British have marched to Buenos Ares because of the Falkland islands in the 1980s ?   .  

Defense is proportionate defense : any more  is merely opportunist  aggression .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prior to the outbreak of World War II Jews weren‚Äôt known for killing Germans, it was only after they started murdering Jews that the Jews fought back.  


Same case with Palestinians . There was no trouble until the First and Second Aliyah started to purchase lands and cause depopulation of entire villages and hamlets  , or impoverishment denying  them resources of purchased areas through worker exclusion  or disrupting grazing rights .

Similarly : things didn't escalate to involve  all of Palestinians rather than a dozen or so villages  before Balfour's declaration   , or escalate into an armed rebellion in 1936 .

 Israelis always cry about ""security"" ; yet said security is more about continuing violating others , rather than their own actual safety .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;all the Nazis had to do to stop the Jews from fighting back was stop killing Jews.

Same case is here : except the Israeli-state dosen't kill Palestinians , but far worse: wrecking their lives for decades while taking what's left of the region while they are alive ... such generational anguish is painful . 

What Ashkenazi Jewry been through from 1933-1945 , simply isn't comparable to Palestinians in 1878 Petah Tiqvah to today .  The former was a sad chapter  ; the later is roughly half of their modern history when   excluding the 18th century  Zaydani Sheikdom . 

&amp;#x200B;

OP doesn't claim the situations  are a copy-paste of each other   . What he claims is that there are parallels we should be weary of  as to avoid potential ethically catastrophic disasters .

I'm blaming Hamas and Ben Gvir, Yahya Sinwar and Bibi Netanyahu.

If you're so blind or so biased or so incapable of having logical arguments, I really have no interest in being here.

Some history reading would be helpful. Arab Nationalism started in and is very massive in Egypt, a country that is 90% Muslim and has a huge army with a lot of dead soldiers from the Israeli wars. We made peace and are friends now. So stop using the words ""impossible"". If you want to give up and just take it out on Palestinian civilians, go do that, but Arabs interested in peace like me waste their time talking to emotional people incapable of having intellectually honest discussions.

I sincerely wish and hope your family and friends remain happy, safe, and healthy. Much love from Egypt."

Israel have plenty of eye in the sky. Even post launch, they know where the rockets are coming from.  
Take the imagery to show the world, and then crate the place. Making it a 100m crater.

Let me address your points as you‚Äôre the only one actually discussing. 

1- if you think we don‚Äôt have the right to defend ourselves = you might hate Jews, I don‚Äôt have anything to argue about this point rather than saying we are here now and we are defending ourselves corresponding to 7/10 attack specifically and from the continuous rockets fired towards us ever since, if you say it‚Äôs a action and reaction, well I can say in controversy that what Israel does is reaction to years upon years of rockets fired at us with no divide between civilians cities to military bases. 

2 - you‚Äôre taking all of our legitimacy to have our own Jew country with stating that it was just to ‚Äúget Jewish people out‚Äù which is anti-Semitic statement by itself. 

3- first of all, in 48, doesn‚Äôt matter for what reason you think to yourself, we got the right to establish a country. 2 countries to be precise, which one side (the so called ‚Äòpalastines‚Äô even though there were no country named like this) didn‚Äôt want this, yet Jews were ok with that. Anyways we established our country, years later they true to fight us over the lands we had, but we managed to prevail this war and got more space, just like a lot of countries that occupied extra lands and now no one talks about what was before. In that 47 UN vote, 33 were for 13 against and 10 neutral; so we had the full legitimacy. 

4- this is ridiculous. First of all because we have no where to go back, most of the people that came to Israel, came from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Morocco, and so on from ALL the Arab countries. I don‚Äôt need to tell you that we cannot go back there, right? I myself one part Yemen other part Persian (mom from Yemen dad from Persia / Iran). We got kicked out from the lands and came to Israel. Please return all the lands there ( and we had ALOT of lands there) before suggesting us to leave Israel. 

5- it‚Äôs not a stupid question, because instead of becoming this monster people, they could use all the assistance, same as we had, to become strong developed nation, but they didn‚Äôt, unlike us, we thrive the land and cleansed it. Please look at footage / document on how we got the land and what we made it to be. Asking us, after all the effort to give it back is, also, ridiculous. 

6- you do talk conspiracy, because saying Bibi made 07/10 happen is not proven by anyone, please accept the idea that if a reporter says something, it is not necessary true."
k6ypg3t,"And sometimes a new country can appear extremely successful in the first years or decades after it is established, but fall apart because it can't handle a peaceful transfer of power. This is critical, and not appreciated enough. Alexander's empire disintegrated for that reason. For that matter some very big established powers today (like Russia) aren't great at it either. States that can't manage it weaken themselves over time, politicking and sometimes literally warring with internal factions rather than external enemies."

k6ypd6m,"I see this and feel this from the other side. I am a leftist Palestinian, and I have always been for negotiating and federating. I have even made Israeli friends discussing this topic. However for the first time ever, it isn't just the government who is the furthest they've ever been from discussing peace, but the average Israeli too. Everyone seems to have abandoned their morals in order to do what benefits them most.  


As a Palestinian, I will always defend my people's right to live and right to determination. All of us Palestinians will. But now that this polarization has made standing up for basic Palestinian rights taboo in Israel, it feels that we are essentially being forced to stand against literally every Israeli political position, from Likud to Labor. They are forcing us to be the enemy, and it feels like any chance at peace for decades is gone. I'm even starting to rethink my position because of this. Since when has being anti-war been so controversial?  


With all that I have seen, I can't even imagine how alienating everything must feel. And I'm sorry that people online have acted that way towards you. We can only hope things change soon."

It literally says in the article that they strike a hamas target lmfao

&gt;military acknowledged it had damaged the church site while targeting what it said was a Hamas command center nearby

Yes, its called collateral damage, why is Hamas even operating next to a church? Ask yourself that

&gt;The Jabalia camp is UN established.

You already provided a source that Hamas operated from there.

&gt;As for the jounalists this is what the wiki page you linked says. ""has been affirmed by¬†Israel, but denied by journalists who worked there. Israeli authorities claim that they possess proof supporting their allegations, but have not yet shared any such evidence publicly."" 

&gt;So if your proof is ""israel said so and has proof, they just havent shared it for 2 years"" thats not proof.

They shared the proof with US intelligence (also said in the article) but it makes sense that they are not publicly disclosing Information that could possibly compromise the functionality of the Iron Dome

Also the strike had no casualties so what point are you even trying to make?"
k6ypcqr,An organisation is only a terrorist organisation through their actions. If you consider Hamas a terrorist organisation then you should consider the IDF as a terrorist organisation too.

It's not genocide according to international law definition, but one can argue that israels actions are genocidal by nature.

If his employee is posting pro Hamas propaganda shouldn‚Äôt that be denounced by both pro Palestine supporters and Zionist‚Äôs?

&gt;The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant in Axum. The Ark is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Replicas of the tablets within the Ark, or Tabots, are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and kept in its own holy of holies, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Saint Mary, Saint George and Saint Michael.[101][102]

&gt;The Kebra Nagast is often said to have been composed to legitimise the Solomonic dynasty, which ruled the Ethiopian Empire following its establishment in 1270, but this is not the case. It was originally composed in some other language (Coptic or Greek), then translated into Arabic, and translated into Ge'ez in 1321.[103] It narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by Menelik I with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the Kebra Nagast is the best-known account of this belief, it predates the document. Abu al-Makarim, writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. ""The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant"", he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, ""on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.""[104]

&gt;In his controversial 1992 book The Sign and the Seal, British writer Graham Hancock reports on the Ethiopian belief that the ark spent several years in Egypt before it came to Ethiopia via the Nile River, where it was kept in the islands of Lake Tana for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum.[105] (Archaeologist John Holladay of the University of Toronto called Hancock's theory ""garbage and hogwash""; Edward Ullendorff, a former professor of Ethiopian Studies at the University of London, said he ""wasted a lot of time reading it."") In a 1992 interview, Ullendorff says that he personally examined the ark held within the church in Axum in 1941 while a British Army officer. Describing the ark there, he says, ""They have a wooden box, but it's empty. Middle- to late-medieval construction, when these were fabricated ad hoc.""[106][107]

&gt;*On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, Abune Paulos, said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia.[108] The following day, on 26 June 2009, the patriarch announced that he would not unveil the Ark after all, but that instead he could attest to its current status*.

I don't think they understand that Hamas is still able to and will always be able to fight back if you stopped attacking them (i.e. fighting = always unjustifiable if youre obviously magnitudes stronger than your enemy, the side thats obviously winning/losing the least must be reigned in).

A ceasefire is something I agree should be strived for ... but not without the surrender of Hamas and the return of the hostages.

EDIT: another thought is that I understand and empathize with both views that Hamas should straight up wiped out because, duh Hamas, but that other nations prioritize a cease fire + condemnation and demand for hostage return.

k6ynsvv,Why theres so many removed comments?
k6ynsqt,"&gt;Why do you think negotiations fail? Because Israel wants that settler land and Palestinians refuse.

Then why wasn't olmerts plan accepted? The answer is because not having right of return is a complete non-starter for every iteration of the PA/PLO that has come to the negotiating table. Which is an insane position, unprecedented in international relations. I'll explain what I mean later in this comment.


&gt;Which means Israeli support ""nice settlers"" and dont oppose colonialism. 

My whole argument is that yes, Israelis support nice settlers, but not violent ones. That's the point. That Israelis in general revile bad behaviour. The fact that you consider Jews living in the west bank and example of ""colonialism"" is a wholly separate argument that relies on racist beliefs about Jews. There's absolutely no fundamental reason a non-judenfrei Palestinian state can't exist in the west bank.

&gt;You implied it by explaining that there are also ""nice settlers"".

That wasn't my implication. I'm saying Israelis generally want an end to violence.

&gt;The fact that you use refugees as a tool to defend settlers is disgusting. 

Many ""settlers"" are the exact people in my example. I don't see why it's any more disgusting than using the less than 1% of Palestinians who are actual refugees of Israel to argue for right of return for the other 99% into Israel proper, who have never stepped foot in Israel and have citizenship in other countries. 

I support a right of return for Palestinians into a sovereign Palestine which before October 7th would have included Gaza and the west bank. But it would be ludicrous to advocate for right of return to apply to Israel, which is why I also don't support any additional or expansion of any settlements. I just also oppose any kind of population transfer, because it invariably leads to even more atrocities. Reversing history is always a bad idea.

&gt;We are talking about settlers outside Jerusalem. Jerusalem itself is completly different beast. 

Why? Do most people not consider residents of ma'ale adumim to be settlers? Jewish residents of east Jerusalem? I just used it as an example but I could have easily just said Hebron.

&gt;1. Many settlements are built on stolen or confiscated land left after palestinians fleed

Show me literally one. The whole idea of the west bank is that Palestinians who used to live in what is now Israel proper fled *to* it. Not from it. Jews building settlements in between Arab villages isn't ""building on stolen or confiscated land after Palestinians fleed"".

&gt;2. Israel only wants annexation of Settlements in agreement

You literally raised a counter example of this for me and said I wasn't allowed to use it for... Reasons? Plus, ""annexation of settlements"" could mean anything from one settlement to all of them. And they're usually focused on Jerusalem, which earlier in this very comment you said was a ""different case"".

&gt;Israel still refuses to compensate expulsed Palestinians

If it was a matter of paying Palestinians a few billion dollars to end the conflict, there wouldn't be a conflict in the first place.

I mean the only compensation the PA seems to want is the ""right of return"". If you also believe expelled east Germans had a right to ""return"" to what became Poland, or you believe that occupied Japanese had a ""right to return"" to America, then I'd at least accept you were being consistent. But demanding a ""return"" to a place they never lived in, while the country of their nationality (Palestine) exists, is completely inconsistent with how we understand refugee rights in the rest of the world."

But no... they accupied it with violance. So violance they got. Im not pro Hamas or whatever. But the Jews are wrong... this shit began in '48. Thats a fact. I always was kinda pro Isra√´l. But the fact Brittain GAVE the Jews this Land is MINDBLOWING. OFCOURSE the PA peole are saying NOPE. I know, the PA people were resisting at first. But that is NO reason to do what Israel did. Imagine, the USA give a part of Israel to Christian Urkainiers. But, the are taking a bit more land. And a little more. Sometimes using the racist card to everyone who stands up and say something about it. Even the Jews are going to be fed up at one time. Thats logic. I mean, look at what migration is causing in France, Sweden and so on. People dont LIKE it when too much of a other nation is slowly moving in your land. 

I've seen so much gore video's of IDF shooting at kids. Even from the nineties/zeroes. The journalists they killed (sometimes by accident and sometimes not). Let me tell u this: BOTH IDF and Hamas are terrorists. Both should be taken out. Hamas is also controlling the PA people. With blackmailing, violance and brainwashing them. I also believe that this generation of Isra√´l people, is also brainwashed. They only see one sighted news. Propaganda. Etc. So yeah, that is also LOGIC that they hate the Palestines. This hate is thaught. Both parties dehumanise. Otherwise you could not pick up a gun and kill people with so much hate.

Isra√´l made a open prison and occupied illigal land and apartheid. So every born PA is hating them by birth. And when these kids are traumatised and losing their parents because of bombing, its a terrorist in the making IF they dont get counseling and trauma therapy. The proper help can really help children overcome PTSS. BUT these kids dont get that. So, the solution: both parties should stop shooting and end the war. Then the second most important: stop the apartheid. If you want healthy people (mentally) create a save invirement. Make education and work accesible for everyone. This proven to be succesfull. Look at projects at ghettos. Divide the land 40% for the Isra√´l people and the rest to the PA people. But men.... I think its impossible. Because to forgive someone who did so much wrong, is very very very difficult. You must be very strong and see the greater picture. It is easier to be mad. To hate. So, millions of people being alble to do that? I think not. I hope so for both Isra√´l and Palestine. One innocent death,  is one too many."

k6yng6s,"1917: The Balfour Declaration (public statement by British to establish a jewish home in Palestine)

1920s: Franco-Syrian War leads to Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. The ensuing emergence of Palestinian nationalism leads to sectarian violence in British Mandatory Palestine. Violence caused by a rebellion against new jewish settlers. 

The Palestinian national movement seeks to form an independent Palestinian state. Jewish national movement is create in response to the violence. More jews move to Israel to bolster their ranks and protect settlements.

Haganah founded in 1920.

1929: Riots lead to 133 jewish deaths and 116 arab deaths. Jews forced to evacuate Hebron and Gaza.

1930s: Arab struggle draws further support from other middle eastern countries. The Black Hand militant group is formed. 

1936 - 1939: Arab Revolt in Palestine orchastrated by the Black Hand. The revolt becomes violent and is repressed by British forces (with assistance from jewish policemen).

The Peel Commission is established and sought to create a partitioning of Palestine. This is rejected by the Palestinian arabs.

The Jewish leaders Chaim Wiezmann and David Ben-Gurion had accepted the proposal.

WW2: the violence in the region calms somewhat to address the global struggle against fascism. Jews and arabs cooperate together with the British to fight the war effort. Some fringe arab groups establish a pro-Nazi propaganda machine, lead by palestinian-arab nationalist Amin Al-Husseini. His cause is driven from Iraq and he is located to Nazi-occupied Europe, where he calls on the Germans to bomb Tel-Aviv.

Holocaust: as the full scale of the horrors of the shoah are discovered, the more jews seek safety in Palestine. Tensions and violent clashes re-emerge as a result. The British attempt to slow the exodus with immigration quotas. Regardless, illegal movement of people continues. 

1947: UN General Assembly recommend adoption of partition into palestinian arab and jewish states. Arab nationalist groups retaliate with violence against the jewish settlers. Arab Liberation Army formed with support from neighouring arab states. 

The jewish settlers are defensive in this conflict. Their forces primarily consist of Haganah and are bolstered by experienced recruits who fought fascism in Europe in WW2. 

The palestinian arabs are pushed back and their lands are claimed by the jewish defenders. Many arabs settlers were told to flee their homes by the liberation arny for the war and never returned. Causing an unimaginable humanitarian refugee crisis.

1948: the State of Israel is formed. Forces from Egypt, (modern) Jordan, Syria, as well as volunteerd from Iraq invade Palestine and begin attacking the jews. They make major gains into the newly-formed nation state. 

The fighting lasts 10 months. 

The IDF is formed as a professional defensive army. 

1949: an armistice agreement is signed defining a partition plan for Israel and Palestine.

1950s: arab militant groups make regular skirmishes into the agreed territory of Israel. 

1956 Suez Crisis: Israel invades Egypt and temporarily hold territory including Gaza, but cede the territory back to Egypt. 

1964: the Palestinian Liberation Organization is formed by Yasser Arafat. 

1967 Six Day War: Egypt build defensive lines along the border. Israel make a pre-emptive attack and destroy Egyptian air force. Israel invades and takes Sinai Peninsula incl. Gaza. Syria shells Israeli positions in the north, but a peace agreement is quickly signed. Israel gains the West Bank from Jordan.

1970: Jordan-Palestine Civil War results in palestinian insurgency spreading to Lebanon. They use Lebanon as a base to continue attacks on Israel. 
This includes the Coastal Road massacre.

1973 The Yom Kippur War: arab coalition launches surprise attack on Israel during its holy day. Israel victory.

1982: palestinians' attempt to murder an Israeli diplomat leads to them taking sides in the Lebanon Civil War. They are successful and Arafat retreats to Tunisia. 

1980s: palestinians begin to rise up against Israeli occupation.

1987: Hamas is formed.

1990s: Israel and Egypt sign a peace treaty. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process leads to the Oslo Accords. These allowed the PLO to move back from their exile in Tunisia. The establish the Palestinian National Authority in West Bank &amp; Gaza. 

The peace process breaks down due to resistance from Hamas militants as well as Israeli domestic terrorists. Yigal Amir assassinates PM Yitzak Rabin. The peace process breaks down. 

2000 - 2005: the 2nd Intafada leads to open combat. PM Ariel Sharon orders all jewish settlers to leave the Gaza strip. Israel formally declares an end to their occupation of Gaza. 

2006: Hamas win the national election and form a government. There will be no further elections in Gaza. 

Israel blockage Gaza with economic sanctions until the militant organisation formally recognizes previous agreements. They do not. There is civil war and Fatah are expelled to the West Bank by Hamas."
k6ynfm3,"They aren‚Äôt the same. Hamas is a much easier force to fight against compared the the Russian military. The IDF showed their ass with 7 Oct by failed to detect and react to a battalion-strength conventional invasion from a region they blockade and have covered with a wall, sensors, and OPs."
k6ynerf,"You‚Äôre a dunce. Banality is no excuse for ignorance. You‚Äôre all emotional because you‚Äôve probably done a superficial search and I‚Äôve ruined your narrative of Palestinians as victims. Give me a break. Get off the internet or go touch some grass. It‚Äôs liquifying your brain. 

‚ÄúInternational aid has been provided to Palestinians since at least the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The Palestinians view the aid as keeping the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process going, while Israelis and other foreign policy authorities[1] claim that it is used to fund terrorism[2][3] and removes the imperative to Palestinians to negotiate a settlement of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The Palestinian National Authority (PA), within the West Bank and Gaza Strip, receives one of the highest levels of aid in the world.[4] Aid has been provided to the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian non-governmental organizations (PNGOs) as well as Palestinian political factions by various foreign governments, international organizations, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), and charities, besides other sources.

The Ad Hoc Liaison Committee coordinates the delivery of most aid to Palestinians. The entities that provide such aid are categorized into seven groups: the Arab nations, the European Union, the United States, Japan, international institutions (including agencies of the UN system), European countries, and other nations.[5] The United States has been a major donor, providing more than $5.2 billion through USAID since 1994.[6] In July 2018, Australia ceased providing direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, saying the donations could increase the PA's capacity to pay Palestinians convicted of politically motivated violence, and that it will direct its funds through United Nations programs.[7]

The international community has sent billions of dollars in aid to the Gaza Strip to provide relief to the more than 2 million Palestinians living there.[8] From 2014 to 2020, U.N. agencies spent nearly $4.5 billion in Gaza, including $600 million in 2020 alone.[8] According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, aid to Palestinians totaled over $40 billion between 1994 and 2020.[9][10]‚Äù

k6ynepa,Germany had to be defeated twice as well
k6ynemr,"And must be good to feel you‚Äôre right to slaughter innocent people and steal their land because God told you to do so (which, in the case of the Torah, never said so)."
k6ynel8,"This is all correct, but it's missing the biggest difference: the black homelands in South Africa were not lobbing thousands of missiles into Capetown. They were not infiltrating Johannesburg to murder little kids. Israel is not engaged in apartheid, it's engaged in self-defense."
k6ynebl,"I'm gonna risk sounding like a fascist but I think Israel is nothing less of a wonder. People came here and actually created something out of nothing, and Israel is not just a country it's a very successful country even with the wars and conflict."
k6yne4x,So you think Israel is doing nothing wrong?
k6yne2k,Some pro Palestine takes make me sick aswell... At some point you have to face the reality that you cannot blame ALL of Palestines problems on Israel or Jews. There are other reasons they did not prosper that are completely ignored and all is blamed on Jews and that's wrong and gana get you nowhere with this Western world
k6yndh5,"I swear, both sides of this conflict are making the most self-destructive choices

Hamas: ‚ÄúSurprise! We‚Äôre gonna kill a bunch of people and take hostages!‚Äù

*Public sentiment rushes behind Israel*

Israel: ‚ÄúYeah, so, we‚Äôre gonna go ahead and do a bunch of war crimes - let‚Äôs cut off food, water, power, and bomb the shit out of Gaza‚Äù

*Public sentiment turns against Israel to support Palestinians*

Hamas: ‚ÄúBTW you know how the entire world is pissed off about the Ukrainian invasion? we‚Äôre BFFs with Russia now‚Äù"
k6yncv4,"I do to, I think they see it as a wedge issue against Democrats so they can get Trump in"
k6yncql,"The Oslo accords that the PA and PLO still holds means no right of return for Palestinians, no army for Palestine, full control of borders and airspace given to israel, WB is not fully under Palestinian control.

Of course imo this is a terrible deal for Palestine and it doesn't lead to lasting peace and security.

As for the UN 2ss (also supported by PA and PLO) it gives up right of return and any land taken from 1947 and 1948. It also leaves Palestine in 2 broken parts with a corridor secured by israel. And that's ofc the minimum. Any more concessions might be added during real negotiations."
k6ynce7,the mods should remove the israel flair idk why they even added it
k6yncbl,People who think the war is 3 weeks old are the real problem - outraged cos they get their news from social media reels only.
k6ynbqe,"&gt;I like how you say kidnapping and raping to make it sound so atrocious

Because they were kidnapping and raping (and murdering children in front of the parents, murdering parents in front of the children.  Phoning parents to tell them they were raping their children to death, calling grandmother's on their teenage children's phones and telling them they were murdering them.). Posting videos of murder on the victims social media.

I make it sound atrocious because it was all utterly atrocious.  We saw the videos, we heard the calls.  We saw the utter glee on social media that this was happening over that weekend.  Now we see people claiming it never happened or trying to minimise it.  Pure denialism

&gt;Was there Jewish resistance to Germans? Absolutely. 

Like Hamas, The Nazis wanted to kill Jews *because they are Jews*. This is not the same as the Israeli attitude to the Palestinians.

&gt;Will Jewish fundamentalists accept a Palestinian state?

The majority of Jews would have and probably still would accept a Palestinian state, for an actual peace.  And historically we've had enough weight to overrule the crazies.  

Now I worry that time has passed.  The greatest success of Hamas has been in radicalising Jews so that they don't even want to talk anymore.  

&gt;Enjoy

No the last few weeks have broken my heart.  This is an complete failure of humanity on all sides."
k6ynbms,Nearly 2 million people live in Gaza.
k6ynan8,"The Israel propaganda bots are strong in this sub
,If u don't cheer u downvoted hard"
k6ynaj2,So fuck them for visiting their family?
k6yn8tu,"If Israel‚Äôs goal is to eradicate Hamas, is destroying the homes of the Gazans in North Gaza really helping that, because they did it, as well as killed 7000+ civilians, yet Hamas is still there.  

I can absolutely understand the pain that the 10/7 attacks caused, but that does not mean I have to understand the horrible collective punishment that the Gazans need to feel."
k6yn8qt,You‚Äôre right about being confused at least
k6yn8cy,"I think you're slightly optimistic if you think a) Hamas' actions get bad PR in Lebanon among the majority and b) Hezbollah cares about PR. 

The majority view in Lebanon is ""Okay, great Hamas, but we don't want to get burned by this, we have our own problems."""
k6yn8df,This really shouldn't be controversial. If they could release their Russian hostages they can let the Americans go.
k6yn83p,Get his genocidal racist self-victimizing ass
k6yn7vh,"Yeah lets negotiate again with the extremists,what can go wrong!! Wait hezbollah will see that israel will keep on negotiating if they kidnap people and they will start kidnapping. Just a cycle of kidnappings and attacks on israelis. What israel should do is tight the screws, make hamas release the hostages unconditionally. That way it can save face, then claim victory and pull back. Negotiating with jihadis is sucidal."
k6yn7u3,Ask your government to withdraw the tax heaven status made for US corporations. And condition Palestine justice for doing business in Ireland.
k6yn7dx,"horrific double standard  
When that happens in Ukrainian they say Ukraine has the right to defend themselves but Palestinian not, they are terrorist"
k6yn5zo,"Because Palestine is not independent. It controls some parts of the West Bank known as Area A. AFAIK it shares control with Israel over Area B. Area C is completely under Israeli control. That's where Israel builds its settlements. In order to prevent this, the Palestinian government would need either an agreement with Israel on the settlement issue, or an army. It has neither."
k6yn5xu,Let me guess folks are going to protest and blame Israel because Hamas hasn‚Äôt released the U.S. hostages. That seems on par for this last week
k6yn5p8,"I am not American and did not hear about it until you said it now.

This whole things strikes me as something I am too European to understand"
k6yn5id,And uh how does that apply when israel is 20% arabic? And these Arabs have the same rights as jews in israel
k6yn566,Iran really seems like it wants to get airstriked off the face of the earth.
k6yn4dr,Mmmm idk you ever watch those black Israelites talk. Every word from their mouth is purposely inflammatory lmao
k6yn47v,Ya I mean‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs kinda how it is. As long as ppl aren‚Äôt implying that it‚Äôs the US government‚Äôs job to get them out then nothing is wrong with that
k6yn3yc,Gaza war is not 3 weeks old you clown - and Yemeni war has 300k + deaths and still ongoing but obviously it‚Äôs less important for some folk as it‚Äôs Arabs attacking Arabs ‚Ä¶
k6yn3q2,"&gt;&gt; Hamas forces also abducted, tortured or attacked members and supporters of Fatah, their main rival political organization within Gaza

This and torturing/ killing collaborators is atrocious. 

I‚Äôm aware that Abbas and the PA have done the same in the West Bank. 

All of this shows their gruesome actions against opponents. But again, this doesn‚Äôt explain who Hamas is and what they stand for."
k6yn3mm,"Don‚Äôt forget this came out within days of the videos of Palestinian people celebrating Oct 7th on the streets. 

If your going to condemn a few Israelis for making fun of the fact Gaza (thanks to their leadership) is completely reliant on the country they just attacked for water and energy, then don‚Äôt do so before condemning the 1000s who celebrated violent rape, murder, and kidnapping of unarmed civilians."
k6yn3ah,DuckDuckGo
k6yn38v,No but they have infinite armor stats bruh
k6yn326,"Are you brand new? They get literally BILLIONS every year. They get more money and aid than small countries GDP. Hamas planned the attack for a year then did nothing to prepare or protect their people. There is PLENTY of food and fuel. How you think 50,000 terrorist eat and send 10,000 rockets? A blue genie? 

If you massacre thousands you should
expect a severe and equal response. They have had weeks and weeks to leave but Hamas blocks roads and threaten them so they can win the media war with mass casualties for fools like you. Read a book. Watch a video. Stay off TikTok timelines. Just learn more than what your small brain knows today. 

(And Israel handled covid brilliantly for the record. Or are you one of those anti-vax conspiracy weirdos?)"
k6yn2dl,DuckDuckGo
k6yn1z8,"Same logic also israel=isis, but it is a stupid logic,  condem hamas but also condemn israel, you are really not grasping the reality of what is going on here, stay outside israel before they spitt on you ok, and palistine as well because also they will spitt on you for being such a coward"

k6yn1at,"There are already a few videos out now of Israel destroying the tunnels, followed by series of secondary explosions as the munitions inside erupt.

As far as I understand, scanning technologies have caught up with tunnels and can be used fairly easy to locate and map them. The largest difficulty I think for Israel is the fact that Hamas places so much of their combat infrastructure underneath schools and hospitals."
k6yn16u,"Not just seen. *Bragged* about.

That tells me a lot about Hamas. That, in their opinions, burning children alive, decapitating people, raping people at a peace festival, etc....is only likely to \*increase\* their popular appeal. They wouldn't have shared such things to social media, otherwise."
k6yn0jt,"Right, lets trust the terror organization that uses hospitals and schools as rocket launching sites and torture chambers!  
 Here's some reading material about Hamas using schools and hospitals:

""Gaza has no reason to lie"" is a delusional take, you have no idea what you're talking about."
k6ymzdo,You would be seeing the opposite of what they are saying though... People are realizing Palestine is the thing stopping the two state solution from even happening.

k6ymuf8,"And the ongoing Hamas-Fatah conflict? Fatah evicted them from the West Bank, much to Palestinians relief. Hamas also meddles in the ongoing Sinai conflict.

k6ymrlp,"Palestinians voted Hamas as their government, they're not random group that came out of nowhere.

Calling the evacuation of civilians an ethnic cleansing is the dumbest hyperbole. Plenty of Israelis had to evacuate cities and communities thanks to Hamas' surprise war, does that mean Hamas just ethnically cleansed Jews? You tell me."
k6ymrh0,Every Jew that forgot what antisemitism looks like is now reminded of the importance of Israel.
k6ymqzg,Because Ukraine falling will eventually lead to a NATO country being attacked and article 5 being invoked. Ukraine winning is important for keeping the US out of war with Russia.

k6ymqqa,"inhumane acts of a character similar to other crimes against humanity ""committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime"".

Very simple to see parallels between South Africa and Israel, but go off chief."
k6ymql1,"Ceasefire is ceasefire to both, not 1 way. It includes both Hamas and Israel. 

&gt;A simple solution to get a ceasefire: Release all 200+ civilian hostages and stop firing rockets at Israeli civilians. 

Hamas said that though. Stop the bombing, release all Palestinian prisoners, and they'll release all the hostages. Israel doesn't want that because that would be admission of defeat. 

Houthis are fighting the entire south Yemen who are Yemenis lol. It's a civil war in the first place."
k6ymqd6,Probably IEDs for years unfortunately
k6ymq1r,"&gt;Also israel didnt try to get an international strike special operation, to avoid casulties, which would cause pe√§robably least amount of lives.

What do you mean by that? What ""special strike operation"" you're thinking about? And how do you think it ""avoids casualties""? Do you think other countries have some kind of magic missiles that can target Hamas militants, even when they're hiding in plain clothes within civilian apartments?

If the model here is the international coalition against ISIS, it absolutely destroyed at least two major cities (Mosul and Raqqa), killing many thousands of civilians. The battle of Mosul alone lead to between 6,000 and 40,000 civilian deaths, depending on who you ask. Raqqa, another 2,385. On top of that, you have tens of thousands of ISIS fighter deaths.

But most importantly, we still don't really know the casualties from that campaign. Estimates vary wildly, even though it was several years ago. And nobody even knows or cares about what ISIS claimed."

The situations are all of similar causes  , even if they had different results and mechanisms , and nature .

Right, so the Jews who lived in this land before the Palestinian arabs don't have a natural right to it? That's a pretty convenient argument.

&gt; That's the whole point of why this is wrong! Here's land the Ottomans took over from largely the ancestors of those same Palestinians and taxed but allowed Palestinians to continue to live on, and suddenly it belongs to the British Colonial power who, instead of handing it over to the people it naturally belongs to, created the circumstances to more or less eventually have it go to Israel. 

This land was passed from empire to empire, it's nothing new.

Imagine if they would be able to import anything they want on a large scale. If they had Israel's military power, there would be no more Jews in the area.

***Alternative C ‚Äì the alternative that will yield the most positive and long term strategic results for ƒ∞srael.*** *It‚Äôs a workable alternative that requires determination from the political echelon in the face of pressure and the emphasize of the US and other countries supportive of Israel to join the move.*

***Alternatives A &amp; B suffer from significant drawback, mainly in terms of their strategic implications and long-term infeasibility. Neither will provide a necessary deterrent or cause a change of mind and may lead within a few years to the same problems and threats that threatened the State of Israel from 2007 until now. Alternative A is the one with the most risks,*** *the dividing of the Palestinian population within in the Jewish state and Gaza is one of the main factors that makes it difficult to establish a Palestinian state ‚Äì* ***by choosing this alternative it means an unprecedented victory for the Palestinian national movement.*** *A victory that will come at the cost of thousands of Israeli civilians, soldiers and doesn‚Äôt guarantee Israel‚Äôs security.*

***Alternative C: Evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to Sinai***

*1.	Due to the fight against Hamas, the evacuation of the civilian population from the area of fighting is necessary*

*2.	Israel will work to evacuate the civilian population to the Sinai*

*3.	In the first phase, tent cities will be established in the Sinai. Later a humanitarian corridor will be established to aid the civilian population of Gaza and there will be a construction of cities in the North-Sinai that will be resettled*

*4.	A security zone of several kilometres should be created inside Egypt and the population shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to return to the residences near the Israeli border and this will be in addition to creating a security perimeter in our territory near the border of Egypt.*

*Operational steps:*

*1.	Call for the evacuation of the civilian population from the battlefields of where the Hamas attack will take place.*

*2.	In the first phase, operations from the air will be focusing on the northern parts of the Gaza strip in order to allow for a ground operation that will take place in an area that is already evacuated and doesn‚Äôt require combat in an area with a high density of civilians.*

*3.	In the second phase, a ground operation will occupy the territory from the North and along the Israeli ‚Äì Gaza border until the entire strip will be occupied and the underground tunnels will be cleansed from Hamas fighters. This intense ground operation will take less time compared to other alternatives and will therefore allow less time for the chances of opening another Northern front during the fighting within Gaza.*

*4.	Traffic routes into the South must be left open/accessible in order to allow the civilian population to evacuate to Rafah.‚Äù*"

These people, probably you included completely ignore the fact that the whole war would have never happened if the Arab countries would have just agreed to the initial deals proposed by the UN and Israel. Deals in which Israel would be tiny and the Arabs would have much more control. However, since the Arabs couldnt stand Jews having autonomy in the region at all, a war was fought. One of these results of the war was that people were displaced. Blame the Arabs not the Jews."

k6ylew0,Russia needs those bodies to throw at Ukraine. Hamas must sympathize with this goal
k6ylejl,"It's wild to me that Hamas and Russia had such inaccurate analysis on what the US would do. Like they're thinking it's the Bush/Obama time period where the US does nothing or very little in reaction. But as soon as you see Biden's administration reaction to Russia and the war in Ukraine why would you think that the US would not absolutely double down on its allies. I don't get how Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas think the US would not obliterate them if Israel and Iran began to slug it out. Maybe Iran is also a bit dated in its thinking who knows. It's not like the 80s/ 90s where the IRGC gets little response in reaction to their terrorism."

As someone who comments there pretty often : I actually reccomand  people to participate in the subreddit , but they have to know a good-deal of history and politics , and have a whole stash of sources to back-up their opinion  ( Similar to what OP did quoting academic sources .. extractions or direct-hyperlinks would be more preferable )   .

That's not to say the subreddit is intellectually challenging : far from it   , it mostly revolves around stating conformation bias  , or parroting statements without fully comprehending their meaning or implications .

Statistics provided by u/badass_panda on the sub  (a  moderator there ) confirm  the majority of the subreddit's subscribers and participants  are mostly Israeli-Jews and thier sympathists  ([roughly 3/5ths](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ob41kv/results_where_do_you_stand_israel_palestine_peace/)) . I think a couple of threads here already shown a popular view that this is the sub's tendency  .

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalia_refugee_camp_airstrikes



&gt;Did Hamas hide in the orthodox church?

You said yes and linked an article were it says ""Israel‚Äôs military acknowledged it had damaged the church site while targeting what it said was a Hamas command center nearby."" As the first thing.... at least read the article yourself.



&gt;I couldnt find any info on that one, pls provide a source

The Jabalia camp is UN established.

As for the jounalists this is what the wiki page you linked says. ""has been affirmed by¬†Israel, but denied by journalists who worked there. Israeli authorities claim that they possess proof supporting their allegations, but have not yet shared any such evidence publicly."" 

So if your proof is ""israel said so and has proof, they just havent shared it for 2 years"" thats not proof."
k6ykpzh,"Because 54 is a large number.  It's like 25% of the hostages. It doesn't really matter because they are all innocent and don't deserve any of this - obviously.   It's interesting because it's the first I had heard about it three weeks later.  

It's important because it impacts the geopolitical landscape. Thailand probably has a lot to say about this."
k6ykpwo,"First, I don‚Äôt really know what Israel‚Äôs plan is. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd think of its plan if I knew the plan. 

Second, Israel has a right to stop Gaza from attacking it. Gaza still holds a lot of hostages, and Gaza is still firing a lot of rockets at Israel. And, in the real world, countries fight long, brutal wars with much less cause than Israel has. Any international law that says a country can‚Äôt respond to continual rocket fire coming from another country is unfair and unrealistic. 

Third, no matter what the international rules or laws are, Israel doesn‚Äôt have the right to kill a lot of civilians in Gaza over a long period of time because it‚Äôs angry, or because it‚Äôs wanting to eliminate the Gazan problem by eliminating the Gazans. 

Aside from questions about morality, that‚Äôs not a practical thing to do, because Israel does need trade with Europe and the United States, and Europe and the United States are not going to trade with a small country that goes crazy and kills millions of people. 

Those countries may have done comparable things in the past, but times have changed, and the simple truth is that trade with Arab and Muslim countries is much more important to the world than Israel. If the world really has to choose, and Israel looks mean and crazy, anyway, and maybe worse than Syria, the world will choose to work with the scary crazy people in Syria and Iran over the scary crazy people in Israel. 

And, people could say China. Russia. 

They‚Äôre scarier than Israel and, at least in Russia‚Äôs case, crazier, but they‚Äôre big and important and Israel is small and a rounding error. China and Russia can simply do things that Israel can‚Äôt because they‚Äôre in a different position."

k6ykoif,"What restricted jewish immigration was the white paper of 1936 (which promised a country for palestinans and to restrict Jewish immigratikn) obviously the Jewish militas did many terrorist attacks against the brits because of that. 

PLO started to have the discussion of israel late 70s and yes rexongized fully in the 90s. 

Fatah is strongly affiliated with PLO and they basically recognize the two solution. 

At the end , it's clear that israel is in general on the wrong side of history with their settler colonial ideology and they still favor short term security over a legit two state solution. 


The thing is that the palestinan cause is a very popular cause and probably the entire arab ; muslim world support their rights. History also showed us thst indigenous population almost always get back their rights. You can read about the French in algeria or the whites in South africa. Settler colonialism never work (only if they killed everyone like what the Americans did to red Indians + Australians to aboriginals) 

But in the case of palestine , arabs were able to maintain a strong presence of their population inside the lands ( 2 million in israel, 3.5 million in WB and 2 Millon in gaza) also surrounded by arabs...

So this story is determined towards a palestinan liberation and equal human rights hopefully side by side with israel. (Which is the solution I believe in , the rights of both palestinans and israelis for a county and equal human rights should be maintained for both.)"

k6ykiak,"&gt;Shift in Global Power Dynamics: The global political landscape has been evolving, with powers like China and Russia asserting themselves more. Hamas might have anticipated that the US would be more preoccupied with these larger geopolitical issues and less likely to focus on the Israel-Hamas conflict.

This genuinely makes zero sense to me. If the USA did nothing to help an ally after this kind of attack nobody would trust them. Israel was always getting American backing, and this is a way to show those powers, none of who currently match the USA, why they shouldn't hit allies.

So far the USA has just moved things into position. By almost all measures that's small for now."

This usage is erroneous; the compound word antisemitismus (lit.‚Äâ'antisemitism') was first used in print in Germany in 1879 as a ""scientific-sounding term"" for Judenhass (lit.‚Äâ'Jew-hatred'), and it has since been used to refer to anti-Jewish sentiment alone.‚Äù

Eastern Europe. Including every single Arab country forcibly expelling every single Arab Jew in the 50s. 

Why stop there? Look what the Turks got away with the Armenians and Kurds. 

Only one of these conflicts has resulted in an 80 year display of international left wing sOLiDaRiTY. And what I‚Äôm saying is that this obsession with obliterating the State of Israel, this obscene double standard is fundamentally about the fact that the left does not think Jewish lives are of equal value to other lives. That‚Äôs ethnic nationalism is acceptable for India, Turkey, Pakistan, and every country in Central/Eastern Europe, but not if it is carried out by Jews in the name of self determination and self defense. That the Jews have to be first in line to renounce their state. Because something something colonialism. 

I have no particular attachment to any political settlement to this conflict in a vacuum, but the obsession of the worldwide left with liberating Palestine‚Äîand not one other freedom march is a demonstration of the fundamental emptiness and meaninglessness of it."

k6ykb4w,"Its not just that they were there 3500 years ago, its that there were still Jews that remained in Israel over that whole period. Yes, Jews became a minority in the region after the Romans slaughtered and displaced them, but there were still many Jews that stayed. Then, after the Holocaust many Jews moved to the region of Palestine legally, while it wasnt a country and under the jurisdiction of the british. Keep in mind Palestine at this time was more Arab than anything else, and Arabs are relatively new to the region in history. The Jews, who had LIVED THERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS OR HAD LEGALLY MOVED THERE then decided they wanted there to be a legitimate country within the region of Palestine, independent of the British. The British, already stretched thin and getting tired of their colonies was okay with this. IT WAS ONLY THE ARABS COUNTRIES that said no. Then those Jews fought a war with the Arabs to claim their right to have a country, ON LAND THEY ALREADY LIVED ON. The Arabs lost. Then the Arabs fought more wars over the last 100 years, always consistent with the idea that they couldnt accept the idea of a jewish state in the region ON LAND THE JEWS ALREADY OWNED. You are delusional. Read the history or shut up.

Edit: Btw your Roman example is hilarious because Romans are not natives to the regions they conquered, native means you were the first people to settle and create civilizations on the land. Romans just conquered. Matter of fact just like how the Arabs just conquered and thats the only reason why they are in Palestine. Because Arabs arent native to the region but because they raped, pillaged and murdered the actual natives, yall treat them like they are actual natives which is CRAZY. Even Americans all acknowledge they destroyed the Native Americans through conquest. Noone in the US thinks they have Native rights to the land. Arabs just think because of religion they should own Israel. And because of religion they have an ancestral right to it. Well guess who those ancestors were to Islam? Those ancestors that give Islam the ancestral right to live in Israel? Jews!"

k6yk08y,"Tell that to the 2 million Arab Israelis!

Ever since Israel was established (Palestinians were multi-cultural: Jews Muslims Christians) Israel accepted any Muslims in ‚Äútheir half‚Äù. 
After it was attacked day one and pushed back 5 enemy states expanding its borders. It allowed anyone who wanted to stay in their homes to stay. Many fled (700000). Many others stayed and have thrived for generations 

 **there were extremist Jewish groups who didn‚Äôt make it easy for them. The state itself allowed them to stay.  This is where the false colonialism claim comes from. Israel has since (mostly) rooted out these hateful groups. While you‚Äôll find extremist sentiment (deep hatred for Arabs who attack civilians regularly ) they are non-violent and if they would get violent they‚Äôd get arrested in Israel (by the state)

These Palestinian Muslim, Bedouin, Druze, and Christian Israelis serve in the army. I believe they have options to not participate in wars against Palestinians and serve in locations without a conflict of interest or them. 


The 07Oct attack did NOT differentiate between Jews and Muslims and Druze and Christians. All were slaughtered raped and kidnapped. 
There was one story of a Muslim Palestinian begging for his life and praying and begging in Arabic. They shot him in the stomach dragged him through the streets (he survived). A Muslim family was slaughtered with the child brutalized.
Other stories of Druze and Muslims have been floating around. Some of heroism and others horrifying beyond belief"

This is among [other attacks on journalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_war_crimes_against_Israel#Attacks_on_journalists). The UN also had an investigative commission which found [Israel intentionally shot children and journalists](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2019-02-28/ty-article/un-council-israel-intentionally-shot-children-and-journalists-in-gaza/0000017f-f02b-d497-a1ff-f2ab3be90000).

So far 8,000 people have died, most of them civilians since Hamas as you say is underground and the IDF is too chicken to actually invade, so they rain hell on the trapped populace of 2 million people, knowingly if ""not intentionally"" killing thousands.

Hasbara to me means intentional obfuscation of the facts in the interests of promoting Israel around the world, with tactics including:

* whataboutism and misdirection
* asserting something very morally simple is so inscrutably complex
* accusing legitimate criticism and protest as simply antisemitism
* repeating without sources or critical thought the talking points of an internationally decried, brutal regime caught lying many times in the past: the IDF and Netanyahu's administration.
* some new online ones I'm learning, like an army of people downvoting and what-about-ing to every post critical of Israel"

k6yjy0y,"I completely agree. It's a counterargument since I see so many people saying ""But what about what Israel has done"" as if this is an eye for an eye situation."
k6yjxya,"My guess is, because there aren‚Äôt expecting America to take the stance it took during the war, it killed any hope for foreign invasions to happen. Israel is at a point where it‚Äôs extremely vulnerable, and countries neighboring would‚Äôve likely already invaded if not for America sending their fleet and possible soldiers. At that point it‚Äôs just a form of bait to make. Because the minute a country attacks Americans soldiers, it‚Äôs just full on war at that point."
k6yjxiw,Why wasn‚Äôt this food distributed to begin with?
k6yjwkd,"1- ""Left it"" after taking it with no right to do so from its local population, left it but strictly controlled trade, fishing, electricity and water supply

2- Yes, the world is backing israel because the bigger picture is a geopolitical game for control of resources like oil and gas and trade routes in the middle east.

3- The Israeli government is the one who couldn't care less about its own hostages when the blindly bomb residential building, hospital and UN facilities. Either they know where they are but are delaying retrieval or don't know and don't care if they're collateral.

4- Caring for peace is now nothing but a mere utopian wish because we're way past the point of no return now... To my deepest regret... No life taken is worth these political games... Trust me when I tell you... I feel you, I feel your frustration, I feel your pain, and I'm deeply sorry that the world has failed all of those who died...

5- The only ongoing holocaust right now is the one being performed against the people stuck in what's left of Gaza... Even if you don't want to admit it, Netanyahu did today when he quoted the bible saying that 1 Samuel 15:3 ""Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly¬†destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and a-ss.""

6- I have no qualms with you, individual, civilian, normal person upset by death, who has been fed propaganda since birth... I don't blame you, but if you were to just read up, listen to what great minds like Chomsky have to say about how history has played out, maybe you'd see the bigger picture.

And if its not, why doesnt israrl allow international reporters in?! If thats not the case.

I take gazas ministry way above the idf, who did the blackout and not allow more neutral media, wait usrael didnt allow that. 

And given that the last election in gaza was nearly 20 years ago, and the ages, most gazans couldnt vote then.

The latter group has centuries if not longer of religious tradition, but are definitely discriminated against. At one point over 98% of IUDs prescribed in Israel were found to be prescribed to Ethiopia Jew women. They also had to abandon some of their practices to be in line with Ashkenazim practices.

Also basing your claim solely on a kingdom that existed 3,000 years ago is not a strong argument. If we followed that logic, we would have to redraw the world map in many other regions as well. For instance, Italians could lay claim to much of Europe, and Mongolia might assert rights over vast parts of Asia. This approach can lead to a series of absurd and impractical claims you see. You seem very much pro- IL so there is nothing to argue about, but if Isreal wanted peace they could have done it in numerous other ways without slaughter or collective punishment.

k6yjeql,It‚Äôs good that you use the South African case as an exemple. Because South Africa is today mostly on the side of Palestine because they recognise in the suffering of Palestinians and in the apartheid state they live in its own history. A lot people are calling the Hamas a terrorist group (and Im the first to condemn their acts of the 7th Oct) but the same could be said about the IDF. And bear in mind that Nelson Mandela was considered as a Terrorist by the USA before the end of the Apartheid. Do you think Nelson Mandela was a terrorist when he tried to free his people ? Let that sink in.

It is. About a 3rd of all males are now in the army. You know what a toll that is on the economy?

&gt;they lack strategy

A lot of modern strategy in the west esspecially in air combat is israeli made. We have strategy.

k6yj9yu,"French, German, and Russians aren't mentioned either. I'm not sure what your point is?

First, information is carefully and slowly being released. Second, it's taken time to identify who all has been taken. Third, whether you did or didn't know something doesn't really seem relevant, and the same statement is true for me as well. For example, I had no idea that there were Russians until I read the article. That doesn't mean they don't matter and/or that it's not being reported - it simply means I didn't know."
k6yj9nj,"I don't think I understand what you're meaning to say. Like, if you're trying to say that Hamas is bad because they still have hostages or something, yeah, I also think they're bad.

k6yj7f3,"A. Excuse me, but comparing what happened to Palestinian villages during a war that was waged on Israel, and comparing it to an a surprise attack on civilians that were slaughtered in the most horrific way is cynical at best. And believe me, I acknowledge atrocities that Israel done over the years, and I spoke about it. I almost haven't seen Palestinians talking against what happened in Oct 7.

b. I'm not talking on the security council, i'm talking about the general assembly decision against Hamas. You need 2/3 in order for it to pass, most of the African and all the Arab countries were against condemning Hamas' actions.

c. Well, my dream is to live side by side with the Palestinians. I think that both sides need to understand that no one is going anywhere.

d. Actually the aid so far gets through Rafah to Gaza. I think that Israel best interest is to make sure that there is enough supply that will get to the civilians, and I believe that Israel is not doing enough with trying to guarantee that. That being sad, as I said before, Hamas is terrorizing the population in Gaza unfortunately, and actually benefits from the chaos in Gaza, so it hard to think how to make sure that the supply will get to the humanitarian organizations, but I think that Israel needs to work more towards it.

e. As I live in NYC in the last couple of years, I can see the Arab population joining forces in protests for Palestine and I saw multiple of those, I never saw one for Yemen."
k6yj7b1,"High Palestinian civilian casualties are in Hamas‚Äô advantage. It outrages the world against Israel and energizes their base. 

Basically, Hamas wants to cause as many Palestinian casualties as possible for propaganda and recruiting purposes. That‚Äôs why they keep attacking Israel. They are like a Hydra. Cut one head, two will grow back instead. 

Israel doesn‚Äôt have a military solution to this strategy. 

Also, that‚Äôs why Arab states won‚Äôt take Palestinian refugees in. Let them stay in Gaza and WB and be a perpetual problem for Israel."

Most other Arab countries have no taste for war and are not willing to fight Israel. So it‚Äôs just Iran (and proxies) vs Israel (and USA), and this is something Israel (and USA) have been prepping for, for decades. They would win. Iran would get leadership change. Syria would fall. Hezbollah, wiped out. Israel would not be unscathed, but they would win, ultimately. And Iran knows this, and it‚Äôs why I think they are only making threats and taking no action."

It‚Äôs like when Democrats in America we‚Äôre condemning Republicans from pushing back against illegal immigrants coming into the US. Once these governors started sending the illegal immigrants to their doorsteps their entire tune changed and all of a sudden it was a state emergency and a problem for them.  

These people who are screaming for a cease fire don‚Äôt live in a country where at any given time missile sirens can go off and they have to urgently get to a bomb shelter. Their biggest concern in life is pulling into a Starbucks and seeing a large line. Anyone with a half a brain supports Israel defending themselves.

The biggest question that should be asked at this point is how far does Israel take it? Me personally I would exterminate all of them. Not because I‚Äôm some ruthless being but because these areas like Gaza and West Bank have proven time and time again they can never be civil. They have so much hate for the people of Israel, they are willing to risk their own lives to end the lives of the people they hate. Israel needs to do whatever means necessary to make sure this threat ends for good so future generations don‚Äôt have to live their lives in fear.

Before I get bombarded with the ‚ÄúOh what about the innocent people in Palestine‚Äù. Are we talking about the same ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù people who were kicking, hitting, and spitting on the hostages/deceased that Hamas brought back with them on October 7th? Are we talking about the same ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù people who were celebrating in the streets on September 11th 2001 when thousands of Americans were murdered? Are we talking about the same ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù people who teach their youth in educational facilities at a young age to hate their neighbors and wish death upon them? 

Israel is left with a tough solution of eliminating the current threat and having peace for 20 years or exterminating them all and putting an end to their murderous cycle when their youth become fighting age and pull off the same attacks their parents had decades prior."

From the reports I‚Äôve read, there‚Äôs no love lost in Thailand for Hamas, and much comparison to their own struggles with Islamist insurgency in the south of their country. However, the Thai people are also quite angry with Israel, for doing too little to protect their Thai guest workers and keep them out of harm‚Äôs way. Israeli tourists ‚Äî most of them young, full of testosterone and bravado, and fresh out of their IDF service ‚Äî already have a reputation in Thailand for being rude and demanding to the locals. Now, diplomatic tensions between Israel and Thailand are becoming quite strained. I see far, *far* fewer Thais signing up to be guest workers in Israel, and I see Israeli tourists facing a much frostier reception in Thailand, at least for the short term future.

In Korea, the televised execution of a Korean hostage by ISIS a few years back outraged the Korean public. Before that, most Koreans were wholly indifferent to Islam and Muslim foreigners in Korea. They were just another kind of non-Korean. But since then, Islamophobia has become very much a thing in Korea, and Islam another kooky, dangerous foreign religion their country needs like a worm needs a freight train.

There's some disagreement on whether Israel should've started the ground offensive now, earlier, or later. But there's very little disagreement among the Israeli public on the general goals. Netanyahu is, if anything, criticized for not acting against Hamas sooner, and assuming they're a rational movement, with reasonable goals.

k6yibbp,"&gt;Until 1949, Palestine was a place where different communities shared resources and experiences. This cultural melting pot attracted people from all over the world who wanted to experience the diversity and beauty of this corner of the Middle East. 

As I understand it, Palestine was pretty sparsely populated until Zionist immigrants started arriving in the late 19th and early 20th century. They bought land, started building up communities, founded schools, set up industries for trade. This increase in prosperity attracted more immigrants, both Zionist and Arab. At that point it became 'a melting pot'. Naturally this also created tensions between the various religions and ethnicities.

&gt;The Palestinians, who had lived in peace and harmony for generations

This is a modern re-writing of history. There was no Palestinian 'identity' until the 20th century. Today's Palestinians are mostly the descendants of Arab immigrants who arrived in the same decades as the Zionists, and their modern nationalist identity was formed explicitly from conflict: in opposition to the British who ruled Palestine, and then to the Zionists when they tried to establish their state.

I'm not dismissing the legitimate suffering of the displaced Palestinians, but if that story above is what they tell their children now, it's a myth. The real history is less glamourous and more messy, not a pat soundbite from the introduction to *AtLA*."
k6yiai2,But Isra√´l has made attacks like the 7th Oct since 1948 ? Why is okay when Israel kills hundreds of thousand of Palestinians ?
k6yia1n,"&gt;The IDF may not be targeting civilians ""on purpose"" ‚Äî debatable, they have been caught doing so in the past many times, including journalists and activists and children

It's very much not debatable, and they haven't been caught targeting journalists, activists or children, unless you believe in the world that Al-Jazeera propaganda wants to produce.

I've served in the British Army as an Officer in the Infantry for most of my career.

I taught Law of Armed Conflict to everything from soldiers to Officers for a large portion of this, have been directly involved in two conflicts, and indirectly involved in another three, including Afghanistan and Iraq.

But never in my career working with NATO allies have I seen them use this level of surgical weapons, and warn civilians of attacks so thoroughly, sometimes even phoning civilians beforehand, which gives Hamas a huge advantage.

It's no secret that Hamas uses an extensive tunnel system dug deliberately under civilian areas, and there is an encyclopedia worth of evidence of them dressing soldiers as civilians, hiding rockets and other weapons among schools, hospitals and mosques, and basically every other Isis-style tactic aimed to get their own civilians in harms way.

There was a large study across NATO about the 2014 war in Gaza, and how it was a golden standard of how to prevent civilian casualties in such a built up and asymmetric environment.

The number of [civilian casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio) caused by the IDF, both in sheer number and in proportionality to combatants, is very very low compared to individual operations within Afghanistan, Iraq, or virtually any other war you choose.

If there were any indication that they targeted civilians on purpose, believe me that I would be the first to oppose them.

Hamas needs to go.

Also no the Palestinian leaders adopt the 2 state solution and made massive concessions. They've been pacifists for 30 years which only resulted in more loses to the Palestinians which in turn gave more power and support to Hamas.

Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians internationally. Many people don't like them and people protested against them. israel on the other hand supported Hamas (source: haaretz &amp; Jerusalem post).

I agree there's a lot of corruption in our leaders. We would love nothing more than kick Abbas out and have a new election.

Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Syria, Iran, Saudis, Iraq‚Ä¶don‚Äôt seem to give a shit and are not getting drawn in. Hamas was encouraged by Iran and Russia, but ultimately their belief of support was misplaced. They idiotically thought the US wouldn‚Äôt get involved, and that they would have the backing of a majority of the UN. 

Put short, they are uneducated idiots who don‚Äôt understand history and don‚Äôt know how to read the room. They trusted the wrong people, they acted on this trust, and now, they are all dead men walking.

It takes hours if not days to count 500 dead bodies, especially after an explosion.

k6yhtub,"It‚Äôs amazing though, Hamas released all the Russians as they‚Äôre ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù according to their leader."

k6yhrz9,"everyone keeps saying that Hamas and Palestinians are completely different and that Palestinians shouldn‚Äôt be punished for Hamas attacks. 

And then you say that‚Ä¶ it makes it difficult to argue that Hamas and Gazan are different."
k6yhrhy,"Yeah the people who support Nazis, proud boys, neo-fascism, or Hamas will have trouble finding job opportunities in the future. Actions have consequences."
k6yhrfs,"&gt;No, the basis of Israel‚Äôs claim is their military power and the backing of the west

So again, if Russia is able to occupy all of Ukraine, you will respect their right to do that? You respect their claim to crimes?!On the basis of their military superiority? And presumably it was fine for the Nazis to occupy France and Austria? And for the Europeans to occupy Africa and South America? All fine because they had the capability?

&gt;You sound like the type of guy who wouldn‚Äôt believe a sexual assault victim unless you watched them be assaulted‚Ä¶ Weird choice but ok. 

Please, name the victim. Show me the first hand testimony. Accusations need to be credible.

&gt;Israel‚Äôs government has lied in the past yes‚Ä¶ There is no reason they‚Äôd lie about this current war

They have the exact same reasons now that they have always had.

&gt;they‚Äôre losing billions of dollars and support around the world. 

They have lost no money, and in fact the US is increasing their financial support. They are losing support around the world, but only from ordinary people. They still have unequivocal support from governments and the mainstream media. Materially they are losing nothing (for now).

&gt;Overall, I think you‚Äôre in denial about how evil Islamic terror is‚Ä¶ Everything Hamas did in the Oct 7 attack is inline with what Islamic terrorists do around the Middle East. It‚Äôs naive to think otherwise

But you don't actually know what they did. You're incapable of finding evidence to support any of what you think happened.

&gt;Why you‚Äôve chosen to defend Islamic terrorism is beyond me‚Ä¶ maybe Edgelording, maybe naivety and misplaced empathy.

I'm not defending anything, I'm supporting liberation and asking for evidence when accusations are made.

&gt;Parading naked bodies (Alive or unconscious) around the town square while regular civilians cheer? That‚Äôs a special type of degeneration

Like I said, I didn't like that video and I don't condone that behaviour. But this goes back to the requirement for perfect victims. These people have known nothing but violence and humiliation for their entire lives. It is just chauvinistic to sit here from the comfort and safety of the west and shake our finger when these people who are fighting and dying for liberation and self determination don't act exactly as we would like.

Also, if she is alive as her mother says she is, that would mean that she was in that truck to be driven to receive medical attention. Context is important.

&gt;IDF soldiers pissing on dead Palestinians is terrible. They should be persecuted

And do you think they will be?

&gt;The more Palestinians think like you and pursue armed resistance‚Ä¶ The more their quality of life will be reduced

Again, would you say this about the Algerians kicking out the French? The Vietnamese? The Haitians? The Ukrainians? 

Why does anyone fight back? Should all oppressed people just accept their fate?

&gt;You also don‚Äôt seem to accept the level of hatred from Muslims towards Jews‚Ä¶ Proceeding this conflict by over 1000 years. They aren‚Äôt fighting for freedom dude, it‚Äôs a murderous death cult

Why can't you stay in topic? We are talking about real events happening in Palestine. This is about illegal settlements, bombing, displacement."

In Jordan for example they blocked the entire dead sea zone and are sweeping the borders just in case someone plans to help out the people of Gaza or try to attack the invading terrorists.

Western puppets that's what they are and most importantly fake Muslims.

k6yhkqj,"I have seen many Israeli pundits go on TV and make the same exact argument: the indiscriminate bombings of Dresden killed so many civilians, but the Allies didn't complain at the time.

Yet not only then, as you say, but even more so now, the indiscriminate killing of German civilians, and even moreso the two atomic bombs ‚Äî which unleashed not the fires of hell but a deeper horror still ‚Äî dropped onto innocent Japanese, really ought to be considered war crimes by the Geneva Conventions.

The IDF may not be targeting civilians ""on purpose"" ‚Äî debatable, they have been caught doing so in the past many times, including journalists and activists and children ‚Äî but, at the minimum, they evidently don't care if civilians die, as evidenced by the enormous amount of bombs dropped ‚Äî amounting to a quarter of an atomic bomb in TNT explosive energy ‚Äî and the extremely high death counts for women, children and the elderly in Gaza that the IDF knew would result.

To deny that is the most grotesquely obvious political agenda, pure hasbara."

k6yhk99,"I think framing like this isn't going to change the choice between ""keep allowing Hamas to exist to kill more Israelis, as well as hold onto 200 hostages"" and any other option of threatened deterioration public opinion. Israeli lives are not for sale for political clout. There remains a clear answer. The only difference that can be created is in ""how to stop Hamas,"" not whether or not to do it. And as awful as it is to have so many collateral deaths, the action being taken is the only plausible option at the moment I've seen, given Hamas' tactics and control of the region.

That sucks that you're going to hate Jews and Israelis more unless they just let Hamas continue to kill them, but that's on you and anyone else who isn't actually having a solution other than telling Israel to stop and let it happen."
k6yhk6t,"Well internet general. You go an enter Gaza without soften the ground first. Sure their is a tunnel opening in those buildings but hey you are Rambo and you would just finish them with your bare hands.

B. Those votes were vetoed by Russia and China, not Arab countries. US back Israel in UN council. 

C. Saudis learned to live with the Houthis in Yemen. 

D. Arab world doesn't have a say about that. They send the aid to Egypt which sends it to Israel to Nitzana and then Israel approves it to be taken to Gaza. If there's failure of aid falling into Hamas it's Israel's fault tbh. 

E. No you were just not invested as it didn't affect you. The Arab world did protest and worldwide media make a joke out out of Saudi. That was Biden's whole point of making Saudi into a ""pariah"" state speech. Saudi stopped ground invasion and didn't impose a full on seige. They also didn't kill 10,000 people in weeks, they killed 10,000 from 2014-2018. That's a big difference."

Christiane Amanpour is also one with a condescending affect similarly to Barbara Walters.
She is a British/Iranian married to a Jewish husband so certainly she has an insight to various perspectives and facts.

Of course you will ignore the 200+ hostages taken, and the fact that many of them were foreigners. You‚Äôre priority is to make sure they are killed in captivity while you distract the world with your terrorist-supporting rhetoric.

The defense was completely dismissed as illogical. Civilian deaths are always horrible, and each and every one deserves sympathy. But comparing the intentional murder of civilians to the collateral damage of pursuing a legitimate target is very deeply immoral.

If the IDF targeted civilians on purpose, I'd oppose it. But that is very very far from the reality on the ground.

k6ygtdp,"&gt;Look just count the number of dead children that were murdered by Hamas on 7th Oct or even this year. And then look at the same number but by Israeli bombs.

I wrote [a whole post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17e1fcl/no_israeli_mothers_dont_cry_harder_than/) on why that argument is wholly immoral and illegal, according to any modern system of morality and law, including international law. and the morality the Palestinians apply to themselves.

As for the last part: let's assume for a moment the IDF soldiers commit Black Shabbat-level crimes against humanity in Gaza, keeping to the same death toll. Kidnapping, raping, and murdering people in a concert, purely because they're Palestinian. Breaking into multiple homes, slowly torturing children in front of their parents, removing eyes, fingers, feet from children and parents, and then tying children and parents together and slowly burning them alive. Disappearing 200 random civilians, including babies and grandmas for ransom, and using them as human shields for IDF operations.

Do you think that at that point, you'd just treat it as just more 1000 deaths out of 3000, 8000, or whatever Hamas is claiming right now? That ultimately, a dead baby is a dead baby, and torturing a baby to death is morally the same as killing him in a crossfire with terrorists that hid in his building? Of course not. There's a reason why Palestinians and pro-Palestinians remember, to this day, the atrocities of Deir Yassin, the murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, the arson of Duma, and not the more mundane, more numerous Palestinian deaths that happened that year. Pro-Palestinians are perfectly capable of differentiating different levels of morality, when the Jews aren't the victims."

5. What about the ones condemning the terror attack? What about the ones protesting for the end of all violence from both sides? What abou the ones who pressured Hamas to release the 2 elderly women?"
k6ygrum,Fuck Hamas i hope we bury them face down under rubble with their asses pointing to Mecca
k6ygrug,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_Liberation_Organization_letters_of_recognition

They recognized them in 1993, and had the Oslo agreements. Unfortunately, while Yasser was mostly good faith, Fatah and Hamas wasn't and chose violence, which led to Israelis using violence to repress them, which led to more violence. If Palestinians had chosen peace, they would probably have total control over their land now. 

The Balfour declaration promised respect for the rights of Arabs, and they tried to restrict Jewish immigration, they just failed."
k6ygroe,You‚Äôve seen photos of the acts committed on 10/7.  You think a sane person does such or a sane person would support such?  Yes they are ignorant.  That goes without saying.
k6ygrj3,"1. Only cuz you're biased.
2. human rights orgs (even israeli) called it war crimes. 
3. You're contradicting your own point 2
4. Only because the fertility rate is so damn high. And yet the tactics israel uses are slowly killing Palestinians. It's not just instant mass killing usually.
5. Your officials and your own official documents say otherwise. (Aka Nakba 2)
6. Yet the Iof is doing the killing. Also Hamas doesn't even have the capabilities to do that even if they wanted to. (Side note: Iof does indeed carry out indiscriminate bombing but it's up to you what you want to believe)
7. israel is the only country I know of that constantly creates fake evidence and lies while financing massive number of people to push propaganda, edit Wikipedia and to flood truths with different fake evidence to create confusion. I don't think any country is able to do as much as israel except maybe the U.S. but I'm not sure."

And don‚Äôt get me wrong I support Palestinians wanting autonomy and independence. But maybe they should have been more focused on not being led by a terrorist group that‚Äôs a proxy for Iran

No one has been worse for the Palestinian cause than their leaders. They‚Äôve gotten rich and furthered their own causes while spending Palestinian lives like it‚Äôs a game of GTA"

k6yglhf,"Thank you for admitting the settlers are extremists that should be rid of. A lot of Israelis under estimate the effects of the occupation and the settlements on peace. I agree. Hamas is also a problem that will need to not have a role in the future.

I said Arabs. I'm talking about Arabic-speakers. I watch a lot of Arabic television from Egypt and elsewhere. For a week, everyone was yelling at Hamas. Khaled Meshaal got a frosty reception and some very aggressive interviews. What they did is NOT okay.

I think the Palestinians are a bit different. Most Palestinians do NOT think there is ANY hope for a good future and will be supportive of anything that ends their brutal illegal occupation. That's not to say that most Palestinians are supportive of kids/elderly being kidnapped (and they're not) but  if you are intellectually honest with yourself, we can admit that history didn't start on Oct 7 and any Palestinian support is directly linked to the occupation. End that or work to end that and all this will go away. Look at what happened with Egypt &amp; Israel."
k6yglan,"Are you talking about the years before when UNRWA, EU, US, Israel and many Arab nations poured billions into Gaza only for it to be wasted on rockets and bombs and tunnels under hospitals and schools. When Israel supplied everything for them after being left alone for 18 years and still couldn‚Äôt build their own infrastructure. The years when they elected a terrorist organization to govern them right into suicide. 

Those years? What about those years? Stupid is as stupid does."

Why would i trust the idf but not hamas when both have apretty bloody history?! 
Exhausted mostly on israels part, who has most of the power.  Like hamas couldnt do declare a devestating ""war"" , as we see israel can. 

If you do the "" there is no other solutions than palestines have to go"" that is ethnic cleansing. 

And sounds like an austro german in ww2 would say it. Its that kind of language. Do i have to call it"" the palestinian solution"" 
Just food for thought."

k6ygey7,TRUE
k6ygeob,"A. I'm not trying to justify a genocide as I also think you don't know the meaning of the word. Try to look at the population of Nir Oz where quarter of the village were either killed or kidnapped.

b. Ah! the UN, with the Arab majority that will vote on every freaking decision against Israel. Of course you'll think that Israel is the most vile state in the world, if you look at UN resolutions, because it shows how corrupt and biased the organization is. If they can't condemn Hamas for what happened in Oct 7, they won't say anything even if there was an Auschwitz camp against jews today.

c. Show me one country that would live with the fact that Hamas is a governing entity that sits on its border after what happened in Oct 7.

d. If the Arab world cares about humanitarian aid and pauses, he would've help to distribute the aid in a way that Hamas is not taking over it and using it. Hamas doesn't care about innocent blood and they say it out loud.

e. lol at the arab world caring about the bombing of Yemen, can you even compare the scale and the protests? saying 'it's bad' and mass protests on a whole different scale are different things. How many worldwide protests were against the Saudis on the war there? how many people in the world don't even know that there is a conflict there?"
k6yge7j,"Exactly. Majority of the money america sends in aid itls spent in america for guided missles, and iron dome ammuniton which is 50 thousand dollars per interception. If we saw they are starting to run out, theyd have to eliminate the threat quickly which means catatasrophic life loss in gaza. Money america sends helps stabilize the region, gives israel time to do precision strikes rather then carpet bombing, and lets usa exort influence on israel to rien them in where needed. If america didnt gelp israel there would be two options;
1. Israel allies with russia or china for weapons or money, (probably china) even if our values are not alligned as israel is a westran country, surviving is more importent,  this will give china or russia a foothold in the ME and america will lose alot of the protections, intteligence, and tech we share with them.
(Israel is the country that invents alot of the high tech weaponry, especially when it comes to cyberwarefare and espionage. This is something america needs, and israel is happy to sell them, or work with them to make.

2. With iron dome or smart guided missles running low, more cheap bombs will be used, which means unguided massive explosions en mass. Aka carpet bombing."
k6yge0j,"It seems like you're a child or you have a thinking capacity of a child, so after your last reply I can see that you have no idea about what you're talking about. I'll clear some points since you're uneducated about the matter.

1- I'm against the call to death of Jews just for being Jews, but It's fine calling the death upon one's oppressor, aka the Zionist. Being a jew is different than being a Zionist, check all the Pro-Palestinian / Anti-Zionist Jews.

2- Colonialist states and UN controlled by colonialist States that themselves are anti-semetic, created Israel to kick out Jews from Europe and buy their Allegiance and to have a strong hold in a strategic area of the world. The establishment of countries is usually done by majority of people living in them, not like Israel where the country was formed by colonialist states that armed militias to kick out the indigenous people and import the population. That's a colonialist abomination of a state.

3- ""What happened before doesn't matter"". To you it doesn't cause the founding of Israel was a war crime, for many following up on the current situation, the history started on October 7. What happened was a reaction, and as the UN chief called it, ""it didn't happen out of vacuum"", it's a reaction and retaliation for years of oppression, occupation, and humiliation. 

4- ""Calling civilians to leave (to where)"", let Israelis go back home to Europe, just by a random survey of the hostages with Hamas you can see that most of them are double passport holders of Israeli and European passports. They can go back to their own countries or their ancestral countries. To Europe, US, Russia, and other countries.

5- It's a very stupid question to ask where European money was going pre Hamas, if you're referring to the European Union it was founded in 1992. If you're referring to any medical aid or food aid, it went for that. You think medical and food aid was the initial funding of Hamas, was that what you were aiming at?

6- I mentioned 0 conspiracies, you can find about anything I said if you search, including in Israeli sources. The Jerusalem Post and Haaretz provide a lot of resources, if you only believe in these."
k6ygdlr,"That‚Äôs how war works 

Civilian casualties are a reality of war"
k6ygdey,"The end goal of Hamas when Israel created and funded it, was to divide Palestinian unity, and undermine the PLO. 

Now Hamas remains as a resistance force to Israeli oppression, occupation, and apartheid. 

Because Israel is a racist ethnostate, with ambition to colonize all of Palestine, it stands in contrast to Israel and its plans to eliminate the peoples of Palestine."

k6ygcrc,What does this have to do with me informing you that the majority of the 1400 Israeli civilians who were killed got actually killed by Israel itself? Isn't everybody condeming Hamas because they think they 'killed innocent civilians' ? well...turned out that as well wasn't true...now what do you want to condemn them for? And what's wrong with having ties with 'Islamic relatives' ? are you trying to say that anything related to Islam is considered bad? I myself am not a fan of Iran by any chance they actually do harm Arabs and did their number on Arab countries...but the enemy of your enemy is your friend sometimes.

So no peaceful times. And what about the 1948 war? You're talking about 1949, and stand by your claim.

&gt;when the west and jewish people came they displaced all the palestinians and put them under apartheid

Didn't Jews came to this land throughout those years though? Beginning to purchase land in the late 1800's?

And weren't there Jews living in this land for centuries?

And clearly you don't know what apartheid means.

&gt;palestinians were who owned palestine before they came

Were Palestinians only Arabs? Or Palestinians were other people as well, ie, the name of the people who lived in the region? For instance, can you name me a famous Palestinian from that time?"

4. U.S. defense companies export arms, generating revenue and jobs.

k6yg1tr,"Also, Israel has dropped about 7.000 bombs, as Hamas claims around 7.000 people died. That means one bomb for one dead.

Im definitely against settlements in the west bank. I think both sides of this conflict are in the wrong in many respects. 

To address your point about violence, i think in some sense youre right but not considering the scale of violence. As it stands Palestinians arent capable of destroying israel. Oct 7 was probably realistically close to the maximum amount of violence they can cause as things stand. If you give those same people free access to israel, the ability to build up infrastructure and receive advanced weapons systems, things change very quickly."

And just tell me if you were hamas where would you hide? In plain site where israel can just locate you and bomb you or underground in tunnels in the centre of your territory?


If hamas hypothetically had higher military capabilities and bombed Netanyahu‚Äôs house and killed his family and his neighbours and their family, that would be considered a war crime, but when Israel does it and kills civilians amongst them then they‚Äôre just using them as ‚Äúhuman shields‚Äù."

k6yfcy3,"
I haven't denied the fact that the Arabs lost the war.
I haven't denied that because of them losing, a lot of misfortune happened to them.
But - you cannot deny that it was their choice to start the war, and the faith of the Jews was far worse if the Arabs would have won.
The Arabs armies promised them that if they would leave their houses, they would get those houses back after the Arab armies will kill all the Jews, and the local Arabs believed them.

Also, you are forgetting that the Jewish population of those Arab countries was extinct. Most of them fled to Israel ( my grandfather was born in Syria, and escaped it just before the Syrian Arabs would have killed his family, my father is from Tunisia, and his family fled the German Nazis).



And if you didn't know, the Arabs attacked the Jews constantly even before the formation of Israel as well as during the Independence war; see here;

and westbank maybe. I mean whatever goes on in westbank by the idf westbank with no hamas influence. So why westbank? 

Palestinians use rockets, all that women and children, yes, totally,and civilians, who would not have rockets. 

Look up the history of the idf and them killing palestinians, because they can get away with it if thex scream"" its hamas"" or that time they likely assasinated a reporter, and then shot reported to any person who wanted to attent her funeral. 

What excuse is there shooting at people who just want to do a funeral? Thst one case should at least show the pure cruelty palestinians have a history being treated with by the idf, if not killed under pretenses.

Just like the alleged hospital bombing that killed 500 people that supposedly Israel did when in fact, [it wasn't the hospital, it was the parking lot of the hospital, it was 500, it was maybe about 10-50 people, and it wasn't Israel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEe8pawDMBo&amp;ab_channel=IsraelDefenseForces) \- it was the Islamic Jihad.

k6yf0ib,"So what's your solution? Allow the occupation to continue, allow the settlements considered illegal by the UN and even US to continue?

k6yf0fa,Even the joker isn't that crazy.
k6yezmg,"Hamas are awful. Hamas or a version of it will always attack so long as there is Jewish terrorism (settlers and others) and as long as there is is occupation.

Even if you care nothing for civilian lives, no body actually thinks Hamas can be destroyed militarily. Not even the US, which has been vocal about that with their Israeli counterparts. That's my primary issue with it, aside from me thinking Palestinian lives matter too. There is no military solution to extinguishing Hamas, any more than there was one to extinguish ISIS (which is totally gone now, right? right?) or Al Qaeda (lol)."
k6yez4x,"If you care for peace flip the perspective.
Palestinians live in constant fear and terror. They've been shown times and times again that diplomacy and pacifism doesn't work with israel. But they can't fight back?

Palestinians have been suffering even before israel funded the creation of Hamas and Palestinians have every right to fight for their autonomy and independence."

Same talking points over and over. If you're not intelligent to understand who is in the right and who is in the wrong in this scenario it's not my job to explain it to you. Evil people murdered and raped 1,400 Israeli civilians they are the bad guy. They kidnapped 200 plus Israeli civilians brought them back to Gaza to cheering crowds. Once again they are the bad guy. 

Israel is trying to protect its civilians and return the captured and tortured hostages. Israel is the good guy. If this is too confusing for you jump off a bridge"

But yeah I‚Äôm not a fan of Bibi or his far right whackjobs either. But it‚Äôs not like Palestine has even remotely entertained peace EVER so it‚Äôs hard to lay all the blame at Israel‚Äôs feet

And by what metric is Hamas winning? They seem to have gotten a TON of Palestinians killed, but that seems like a weird metric to use unless you also acknowledge that dead Palestinians is their objective"
k6yerqe,"That‚Äôs why I think flattening the area is the answer. Don‚Äôt push into Gaza, go block by block evacuating people, bulldozing every structure, check it with ground penetrating radar, possibly pave it, and move to the next block without worrying about anyone popping up behind you. Discussions about rebuilding can be had afterwards"
k6yer8x,"Which other countries have the Palestinians caused problems in? Are you talking about the State of Israel, built on unceded land, based on an agreement they rejected? You'd have a much easier time understanding why anti-Israeli sentiment exists, and is only further propagating, if you'd stick to the facts and valid, logical comparisons. 

Not to mention, the *deeply flawed* and grotesquely unethical argument that terrorized, oppressed Palestinians haven't been allowed to govern their own land ""successfully"" (by whose standard?), therefore that land deserves to continue to be colonized and its people terrorized.

If I'm a bad spender, for example, it doesn't give a more shrewd one the right to *rob* me just because they *assume* and believe what they would do with the money is better than what I'm doing with it. This would be grossly unethical--it's why every country on the planet prohibits this.

The land in Israel belonged to Palestinians. 

Only a very narrowly selective view of history would allow even someone lacking all compassion to make this argument with honesty because it ignores the impacts of Colonialism (such as revisionist Zionists murdering any capable orator amongst the Palestinians who could have had a political future); socio-economic factors (Israelis had practically unlimited outside financial support); and global political factors that limit the capacity for support and self-governance in legislatively stateless territory. 

There is objectively not enough evidence to draw on to make the (disgusting) argument you've made here."
k6yer1r,"Jews actually did that to the Romans which led to the Jewish diaspora in the first place

k6yeqqj,This will be the second time Israel militarily defeats and occupies Palestine.
k6yeqnb,"I dont think the two state solution is feasible. Sure as a westerner its cute to sit here and think that if Palestinians just had their own state everyone would be fine. I dont think thats the reality on the ground.

Both Palestinians and Israelis don't want a two state solution.

Israelis ruling party believes that the west bank (and probably gaza) should be part of Israel.

The palestinian people do not want half of Israel. They want from the river to the sea.

Suggesting a solution that neither side has any real interest in is pointless. Even if both sides reluctantly accepted, i have no doubt that war would break out within 10 years and we would be right back where we started."

You can use ""it could have been me"" for being born into a neo-collonial cobalt mine in fckn Africa or whatever, but I'm guessing you don't actively think about those issues and why would you. You just think about countries or human suffering that have a direct link to you? Like, places you've visited, or...?

k6ye8b9,At least they aren‚Äôt being murdered in their homes for three weeks.
k6ye7x1,"&gt; She types it okay

No she doesn't, ""Ben Giver"" isn't the same as ""Ben Gvir"" and even the most illiterate person in the world could see that, I'm sorry but that's basic ABC.

&gt;I believe them over you tbh.

Of course, I wouldn't expect you to, obviously, but I literally live here, I've been against the judiciary reform from the start, yet I didn't see anyone being wrongfully imprisoned for supporting the anti reform demonstrations, and I couldn't find anything on the internet on that. As I said before of course some protestors were taken to police stations but they were violent/disrupting policemen.

If you did find any article about someone who was wrongfully imprisoned and is still in jail, please, by any means, enlighten me."
k6ye7tz,"I think generally it means do whatever it takes that this won‚Äôt happen again.

In a more practical sense, it means that we won‚Äôt just see our neighbors killed by those who said they‚Äôre going to kill us all and carry on with life and just wait and see how things turn out ‚Äî we‚Äôll rise up and defend ourselves."
k6ye7tt,"I see a lot of people condemning the IDF for being completely unprepared on the 7th, and for killing civilians. 

I dont see anyone supporting hamas, feel free to show some comment who do, I havent seen them at all.

MANY people like me have the viewpoint that both Hamas and the IDF are reprehensible and both committed war crimes. Some people just aren't cool with murdering or bombing children, its not hard."
k6ye7p2,"Fuck off, Nazi"
k6ye7k9,"Don‚Äôt mind the haters. They didn‚Äôt see your art. They only saw a discourse they can only relate to in opposition. 

I once heard that beauty is a sad story well told. 
You did a beautiful piece."
k6ye7k2,"The Jews didn't make it their goal to kill a nation of people. No where in any official Jewish document of Israel you can find ""killing all the Arabs ' a goal of Israel. 

I think that it's insane you can certainly find such a goal on the Hamas charter (and also in the ashaf charter before they changed it) and people still say Israel is the genocidal one. 

Mossad killed terrorists abroad before. I don't know about the specific case you mentioned but I can find out. Also the fact they kill individual Palestinians doesn't prove anything of Israels goals"
k6ye7gg,"So why can't they leave? Why are Palestinians constantly denied visas and passports? Many of the ones who are given visas are tracked down by the IDF are interrogated, and sometimes disappear.  


America made the same mistake you did hundreds of years ago with the Native Americans, we didn't decide to kill them all off; we decided to acknowledge the wrong we did and work towards a better world where bloodshed is exchanged for love and community. Thousands of acres of land is returned to Native American tribes every year.   


We realized our mistake and are trying to fix it. That makes us better."
k6ye7dz,"I like how israel always claim they were attacked first at each stage
Leaving out the Hagana and irgun terrorism and the 1947 explosion of Palestinians that led to the 1948 war
Leaving out that israel preemptively attacked Egypt in 1967 due to their Paranoia.

But no ""israel is always the victim"""
k6ye7at,"I did. You allegedly love Palestinians.  Nothing wrong with them.  But you don't take them.  Interesting.   

The fact that you can't separate Palestinians from Hamas is very telling üòÜ"
k6ye79k,"&gt;I mean what I wrote

So up until 1949, the middle east was heaven?

&gt;They lived good and in peace before that and even a few Israeli people live there

And again, what happened in there 50 years prior? Because it's not as if 1949 came and suddenly the Middle East became a hell hole.

&gt;What do you mean who the Palestinians were?

Who were they? It's a pretty self explanatory question."
k6ye6ue,Just flood the tunnels with shit
k6ye6qb,"You're right the responses are very predictable. They only have a couple of arguments and when challenged they become insulting. However recognizing these things in comments allows you to fuck with them a bit before asking about the Covenant, after which they stop responding."
k6ye6mv,"The international Jewish finance cartel is the only reason governments, politicians and companies support Israel. They are paid by them. Money rules."
k6ye5oy,So honest question - what should they do?  Nothing?  After the events of Oct 7 there‚Äôs a lot of people shouting ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù and ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù but they seem to have no answers other than expecting Israel to just not do anything.
k6ye5nz,TIL Hamas is unaware of the US response to Pearl Harbor
k6ye5gs,Nazi logic

k6ye54i,The fucki*g Negev didn‚Äôt have anyone
k6ye4vl,"Yeah, but, it's like, anti-colonial."
k6ye4kw,Just mentioning that ‚Äûwegschauen‚Äú (looking away) is a general term for ignoring something
k6ye4m1,"Is there a problem with the word jews? If you feel it is not right then i dont know, i am an arab, it is not my goal to be condescending to the jewish people, they are great people whom i love personally.

But zionests who are eating bread from killing and wiping out entire blood lines are not even practicing Judaism, it is there bread and butter to kill us.

And the fact jewish people have enormous wealth is well known, you can just call me an antisemite for stating a fact, i am not an american who will shake his head in approval for whatever you say!"
k6ye4fd,Well - I think you did...
k6ye3q1,"Not at all. When someone tells you he wants to kill you, it is advisable to believe him. So go to hell and take Hamas with you."
k6ye3pf,This is the reason why people join Hamas. Fatah is ineffectual and was essentially betrayed by Israel. The PLO (Fatah) has no power and it was always inherent to the arrangement. The Oslo Accords grants the Israelis almost all power to the security apparatus of the Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority submits to all verdicts from Tel Aviv.

k6ye2nu,Thank you for this. So Israel is truly pulling a white settler colonialism strategy?
k6ye2m8,"I guess Kuwait forgot about its own experiences with the Palestinians. If Iraq tries to kill them again, perhaps don't save them this time?"
k6ye29f,Legend
k6ye1h7,"Lol at OP trying to justify a genocide by pointing towards another. Classic whataboutism. 

And to answer your question, Saudis got shunned and had multiple arms deal blocked despite they had a UN resolution backing them. Saudi even abandoned multiple ground campaigns like taking the port of Hudaydah or imposing a full on blockade because humanitarian organizations were against it. Even Biden removed Houthi terrorist designation because of it.

Saudi Arabia had way more support and UN backing than Israel does now and yet they didn't do a ground invasion and stopped the airstrikes with international pressure. Israel lashes out at anyone in the UN who even suggests for humanitarian pause.

Also the Arab world strest was against the bombing of Yemen btw. It's not just because Israel is Jewish that the Arab world is against it. That excuse is lame everytime I hear it."
k6ye0ej,"This is the politics of gruesomeness I referred to in my post. This is gruesome, to be sure, but that doesn't excuse perpetrating gruesomeness sevenfold.

6 year olds learn that two wrongs don't make a right. What are you saying here? ""They did it first!?"" Grow up."
k6ye07g,Source on Bibi supporting Hamas? Are you just referring to letting aid into Gaza from Qatar via Israel
k6ye01w,"Look up Mary manning, do as she did."
k6ydzwj,"Absolute victory worked well in Japan and Germany. The US military brought Japan to its knees in unconditional surrender via overwhelming force. We then engaged in reconstruction and now are strong allies. The Allies did the same to Germany, rolling tanks and artillery fire through every inch of Germany until its unconditional surrender. We then occupied and rebuilt, and are allies. 

War is a nasty, horrible, violent thing. Japan and Germany were crushed into total defeat, yet we don‚Äôt see terrorism from Germany and Japan against the USA. 

If Israel goes for the absolute destruction of Hamas, that will be a good first step. Lasting peace could potentially come from what they do NEXT. If they engage in reconciliation and reconstruction peace is possible. I don‚Äôt think less of the Palestinian people than I do of Germans or Japanese."
k6ydzlg,"shes a staff member probably some random ass receptionist sucking the cocks of all the professors in the department I dont think she has a formal education

k6ydy9u,"&gt; Or they are doing what terrorist are best as. 90% of them throw away their guns and put on civ clothing. Then wait until they can return and build up again.
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is that they will never have a chance to come back. And that they will go be terrorist in some ~~middle eastern or African~~ **European** country instead.

Ftfy. Sweden, England, France and Germany is my best bet."
k6ydxdw,"To you the hostages and the civilians of Gaza might be just a means of propaganda. 

To real moral people they are living humans. It proves the utter disregard for human life on both sides from the Palestinians.

And don‚Äôt confuse the issue. There are no settlers in Gaza. They were evacuated in 2005 and left behind buildings and greenhouses that the Palestinians destroyed. Because destruction is their greatest talent."
k6ydx5r,"I don't think Hamas, Hezbollah, or Iran expected the US to park two carrier strike groups in the Med. I'd hesitate if I were Hezbollah and co, too. They might be prepared to die, but having your whole invasion force annihilated by an enemy you probably won't touch is not very conducive to their long term goals. If Israel goes balls deep with a ground invasion, it's hard to say what will happen. I think they waited to see how the west would react and didn't expect them to show up specifically to deter them."
k6ydx6c,"Egypt was literally occupied and not a sovereign country in 1948. We were under an incompetent Ottoman king. Egypt became independent and ruled by Egyptians in 1952, so I believe it would be fairer (and simpler) to look at what we've both done since then. 

But if you're referring to the Cairo bombings, I am happy to of course take a look at that. Anti-Jewish riots that claimed 70 Jewish lives is not okay. Neither is the Deir Yassin massacre by the Jewish terrorist groups of the Irgun and Lehi that claimed 100+ Palestinians six months earlier.

Let's have an independent commission look at all of it, same as they've done with other conflicts. We can all apologize and acknowledge, re-pay and fix together.

Fair is fair, no? If it's consistent and coupled with actions on the Israeli side, look at everything."
k6ydwzb,UN definition. Genocide means targeting civilians and israel isnt doing that. And it means trying to destroy another group which also doesnt happen and palestinian population growth is the highest in the world.
k6ydwjr,"The problem is how do you logistically speaking, remove hundreds of thousands from settlements that they‚Äôve been resident in for decades? There are no easy answers."
k6ydvs6,"My brother of the internet,  Israeli children are taught at a very young age to hate Muslims and to consider them lesser. You see it in how the Israelis make TikTok videos joking about the Palenstains for not having water. How fucking brainwashed do you have to be to see somebody without water and to think, "" Thats funny, I should make a video""  


You wanna talk about who's complicit? Let's talk about the thousands of Israelis who were against the torture or death of Palestinians, only for them to be jailed or have to flee the country because freedom of speech and thought doesn't exist in Israel. Netanyahu just gave a speech saying to kill children. And you think iran is the problem?"
k6ydutk,"Why do you think Israel is taking its time before going in? It has always been about gathering intelligence, and disabling Hamas as much as possible with precision strikes, before going in.

The reality is, if Israel wanted to level the city, they could have done it long ago. Right now, they‚Äôre striking a balance to minimise casualties while creating as favourable conditions as possible for their troops to go in."
k6yduhk,"Second battle of Fallujah: USAF spent the time and effort to evacuate 300,000 civilians BEFORE attacking an urban city centre.

IDF began bombing Gaza immediately.

Also the USAF primarily attacked on the ground, clearing house to house, rather than relying on airstrikes and reducing everything to rubble.

Huge risk to their soldiers but it minimized civilian casualties."
k6yduf5,"LinkedIn has always been absolutely insane. Seriously, even 4chan at its worst had serious value"
k6ydu5c,Im talking about the middle east. the progroms happened in europe
k6ydtdd,"It‚Äôs a very good question and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting a lot of knee-jerk responses. We‚Äôre all on edge. 

I‚Äôm of two minds on the supply cutoff. It serves a few purposes: in any other situation, the fact that Israel supplies Gaza with everything it needs to function SHOULD mean we have the leverage to deter violence and force them to negotiate towards peace. However, as we were just discussing on the other sub, the concept of ‚Äòmilitary superiority/nuclear capacity/supply monopoly‚Äô as deterrence and leverage only works under 2 conditions: 

1. They believe that you will actually use this, and do not ‚Äúcall your bluff‚Äù
2. They care

We can only attack the first one: in essence, they called our bluff, perhaps believing that we wouldn‚Äôt respond so strongly in response to international pressure. We have to show them that it‚Äôs not a bluff. 

The Palestinians are responsible for the second. We can‚Äôt make them blame Hamas directly: we can only continue to respond negatively to bad actions with enough consistency that eventually they will make the connection between firing on us and getting fired upon, and connect that to Hamas, who does the firing. 

On the other hand, I see your point that there may be minimal direct tactical consequences for Hamas. It is horrible to know that there are people who don‚Äôt support Hamas who are now suffering for its actions. However, that is the case when any government decides to go to war; the people suffer. Innocent Russians have suffered massively from Putin‚Äôs decision to invade Ukraine. They‚Äôve seen their friends and family conscripted and used as cannon fodder. They‚Äôve further lost their freedoms or been forced to flee their homes, perhaps never to return. This is what war is: powerful people decide to set in motion things that will inevitably kill innocent people who didn‚Äôt sign up for that. 

I don‚Äôt know why more supplies aren‚Äôt getting through the Rafah crossing. I don‚Äôt know why the Gazans thought that their total reliance on us, and simultaneous war with us, was smart to begin with. This war is so tactically insane and irrational that I can barely even offer commentary on it. It‚Äôs almost as though their strategy is to do the stupidest and most insane things possible in the knowledge that some people will seek to invent justifications for those actions and even use it as proof of their underlying convictions against Israel: ‚Äúsee, look at them acting crazy, you drove them insane! _Look what you made them do!_‚Äù"
k6ydt8m,"There are 2 million civilians there. 1 million kids. And you think it's somehow absurd/unethical/stupid that SOMEONE actually raises the concern about what happens to them?

Sometimes it sounds like reddit thinks Gaza is a military camp with 10k Hamas soldiers and nothing else...

Gaza was the world's largest prison. Hamas the leading prison gang, and they hold 230 Israelis and 1.9 million Palestinians hostage in there."
k6ydsp8,"Palestine supports Armenia‚Äôs expansion to ancestral lands while Israel actively funds Azerbaijan
No, recognition doesn‚Äôt equal to whether they support or not; remember, both the Soviets and the US supported the partition (Old Yishuv didn‚Äôt approve and had a Palestinian state been once established firmly, then only would secular Jews mostly leave, while Orthodox Jews and those willing to take on Palestinian citizenship would stay)"
k6ydsmu,"Do you not see the 10‚Äôs of thousands of people marching in support of what hamas did on the 7th? Do you not for one minute Think that hamas enjoys at least similar support within the Palestinian populace? You can‚Äôt be that naive to think that Palestinians don‚Äôt support hamas, right?"
k6ydsbj,"You got your whole story wrong though... The Jews didn't take any land forcibly until 48. Check out the names of their organizations, Hashomer hagna (literally ""ther guardian"" and ""defence "" in Hebrew) it was about defence, passive, protect. 

Until the 30s they were completely passive only protecting themselves from Arab aggression. 

The Arabs might have felt they are taking their land, but it was a self fulfilling prophecy, it wasn't a reality until the Arabs tried to murder them all. 

And it's super tragic. But even more tragic is the Palestinian lack of accountability and responsibility taking. Their inability to take responsibility for their action has been the number one obstacle to peace."

k6ydrip,"They don‚Äôt just leave them to die. This again is a lie. They actively prevent them from evacuation and encourage them to martyr themselves for the cause by staying in building they know Israel has to blow up. Those dead children and women and men they literally were placed there by Hamas in the hopes they would die just like that. That‚Äôs why the live feed catches the video, they make sure to pack those building with people. The worst part is with the brainwashing most of those people are willing participants. It‚Äôs sick and btw the UN paid for their education to do this."

k6ydq0a, Israel‚Äôs supporters are like 60 year old evangelical Christians.
k6ydpqr,"Nope, I am disgusted that my government is providing so much aid and unwavering support to Israel's war crimes and genocide of the Palestinian people. I am sick and tired that we are all expected to condemn Oct 7th yet no one from the Israel side wants to or is expected to condemn the atrocities by Israel on this war, with thousands more killed, injured, and millions displaced in Gaza. It's as if the lives of Israel citizens murdered by terrorists on the 7th counts far more than the Palestinian lives lost from the 7th-to today. 

It's disgusting how much propaganda and mind games are being used to justify Israel's insane response, reminds me of how the US used 9/11 for all sorts of human rights violations and destruction in Afghanistan and Iraq."
k6ydpih,What definition?
k6ydonk,"They seem to be doing okay. The only real issue for the last few decades has been Hamas and I think we can all guess how this is going to end for them 

After that Israeli normalization will likely continue, mostly because even the Arab world is tired of Palestine‚Äôs terrorist, anti-peace BS.

k6ydlcc,Man you have really drank the Kool-aid.
k6ydl2k,"Or about the people being bombed... the Palestine/Israel conflict has been a part of American news cycles fir decades. But a whole lot of people can't point out Syria on a map and didn't know a thing about Syria or Ukraine before the wars broke out. Even as devastating as the Syria war was, there is not even a peep about it in the news now. People at least understand the religious and land conflict in Israel/Palestine but they were confused/are confused about why there was suddenly so much importance in Ukraine or in Syria."
k6ydkmd,what about pre 1948 pogroms ?
k6ydkis,"Great question! It's because of a few reasons:

1. Anti-Israel supports are not killed (if they are non-violent, and not Palestinian, exceptions occur). Anti-Saudi supporters will be killed under ""mysterious circumstances"" always - that's how dictatorship works
2. The Palestinian story of oppression resonates  well with the ultra-Left west because of the 70 year occupation argument. Obviously that is untrue and unfounded - if everyone started for asking land from 70 years ago, the world will look very different
3. There are enough Palestinians in the West living a cushy life but still maintaining a victimhood narrative to fawn this Zionist hat.

Lastly not a vetted reason but my understanding: Islamic brothers fighting is okay because they are fighting within the family, Jews and muslim fighting is bad because Jews need to be held to a higher standard, without acknowledging that they do have higher standards"

(Humane) policing, mixed with earnest rehabilitation of the social and political system to include and not discriminate against Arabs or whatever oppressed underclass exists in that society (like Black people in the US). Other countries do it. (Though admittedly the US sucks at it too because we have so many guns). Why can't Israel?

Palestine and Israel were on the verge of peace talks many times only for them to be scuttled by the assassination of Arafat as well as Rabin and other circumstances. Even if past efforts have failed, even if it were true the Palestinians rejected it previously, does not stop or negate our responsibility to establish one, because it is the only way to stop the violence. You cannot put people into a blockaded ghetto (Gaza) and expect non-violence. People want to be free, which is not necessarily to condone the violence they may perpetrate to get it."

Gazan self governance is over.  When the war ends they‚Äôll probably give it over to the far more moderate, far more friendly Palestinian Authority currently governing the West Bank.   - and I do hope that they are successful rebuilding and governing a refreshed new Gaza, supplying its inhabitants with the resources and opportunities that Hamas has so long denied them.

k6ydbjj,"&gt;Is an Israeli life worth 10 Palestinians lives or 100?

If you're asking this question, than you're deeply missing some fundamental features of government. The job of the government is to look after the interests it's own people. The Israeli people vote for their government and not for any other government. Because no other government in the world has the responsibility to look after Israelis, the Israeli government must put it's own citizens above all others. 

If the decisions is one dead Israeli dies vs 1000 dead Palestinians, it's the duty of the government to save the 1 Israeli. Obviously morally this is problematic, but this is what makes the Hamas attack so fucking horrible. Israel has no choice but to do this. They can, and likely will try to reduce collateral damage, but Hamas sealed the fate of countless innocent Palestinian lives with their act. This is is why it's so important not to go over certain red lines. This is why everyone thought a nuclear war was inevitable during the Cold War."

The opinion on this has definitely shifted, from right to defend itself against terrorism to not liking the right wing government that has been unfair to people of Palestine, to total ceasefire now because Israel is over dramatic in its response, killing thousands, with over 50% of people that‚Äôs don‚Äôt even have anything to do with concept of Hamas."

The pro Israeli propaganda regarding this is not that Israel funded Hamas, but that it allowed Qatari money to go to Hamas rather than the government of Abbas. It‚Äôs a weak claim. One way or another the Israeli government allowed Hamas to get funding. 

It should be obvious by now considering Netayahu‚Äôs past and current struggles, his grand ideas that funding Hamas directly would lead to a positive outcome (a lie of his) and ignoring warning of attacks that they either are walking into a trap or wanted this to happen and this is solely due to his incompetence."

Before the attacks on Israel, Palestinians have been suffering under a brutal occupation, where their lands are attacked, houses stolen or demolished and many many abuses that were not getting the attention they deserve.

Why is the world invested now? Well because of the global effect this war has and the many political players that have hands in it. The US, Europe, the Arab world, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and more countries are participating in this war. Did you see an American president visiting Yemen or Saudi to show support or ask for a cease fire? Did any politician visit Burma to show support or be heavily invested against the genocide on the Rohingya?

k6yd0le,"I won't clam to know how to solve this shitshow, but it seems clear to me that any solution must involve Palestinians believing that there exists a peaceful road to peace, and the 'propping up' of the Palestinian fractions which wants peace and negotiation. The fact of the matter is that Palestinians see settlers steal their land, and no real improvements in the west bank (governed by the ' peaceful' faction), making it up really hard to see a peaceful way out.

I think here needs to be both a carrot and a stick. Hit Hamas, but at the same time show real improvements for the west bank, show that Israel is actually properly committed to working together with non-violent fractions, trying to find a real solution, not just strangle them slowly to death."
k6yd0hp,"&gt; you know this money will only mean more death and destruction , since its going to go to mostly bombs. 

the money goes to stop the death and destruction. some of it goes to refill the iron dome, from what I heard it will also go to new patriot systems and maybe David's sling. and some of it will go to keep the Israeli economy floating. it doesn't necessarily goes to the IAF or the ground forces 

&gt;  If you're on the right, this violates basic fiscal conservative principles, that we shouldn't spend any more money than what helps American interests. 

it serves a lot of American interest. we are one of the leading countries in chips and high-tech.

&gt; I already believe 4 Billion/year is too much (with no preconditions) 

its 3.25 from what I remember. but after doing research 500m goes to iron dome and the rest Israel uses to by American made equipment. so it is integrated back into the American economy anyways.

&gt; Israel is one of the richest countries in the world 

and also very expensive. at the end the money is high comparatively but the cost of living is high too.

&gt; with one of the strongest militaries. 

the IDF is strong. but only the serving units are. it is a very small army without reserve. and the American money goes to mostly JDAMs and artillery shells. which btw Ukraine gets a lot more. 

&gt; Hamas is a weak enemy, therefore throwing more money at the problem does very little good 

it is weak. but it is really good at doing guerilla tactics."
k6yczrp,"- If you wanna do a human cost for thus conflict ...palestinans have been killed way way more than israelis ( due to US, eurpean weapons and support). 


- PLO has recognized israel since the 70s. They got nothing but settlements and apartheid. 

-Everytime israel offers a state for palestinans it is with total control over their water, energy , borders and airspace. That state can never do deals with any country unless they get agreement from israel. No dignified human being can accept a formalised form of oppression. 

What is more, east Jerusalem was never part of any offer from israel (which contains the whole core of the palestinan identity , al - aqsa mousqe) . The best plan was ehud barak he offered the ability to ""visit"" al aqsa mousqe but it will be under israeli border.

That's why the palestinans never accepted these ""offers"". (BTW, just for the record, PLO agreed to be a demilitarised country). 

- Regarding Oslo, the PLO followed the plan literally. It's israel that is still building settlements on area B, and area C (around 70% of west bank ) ...technically israel killed the 2 state solution. West bank now looks like Swiss cheese with 0 chance to make a functional country there.

-regarding history , indeed there was no ""major"" massacre incident before the 20s. 

What happened is that the arab educated elite became aware of the zionist project that was developed in Hungary. They pointed out to this danger. 

What is more, in 1916 the arabs helped the British empire to remove the Ottoman empire in exchange thry were promised paleatine , levant and arabia but they were simply used by the British colonial powers. The British did the balfour declaration in 1917 promising Jews a country in palestine (without any respect to their promise for arabs)."
k6yczli,"You didn't answer the question about why the world ignored it.

Did they deserve it? No. Was it necessary in order to prevent the war and to create a better future? Probably"
k6yczfm,"Hamas is supported by Iran. Along with Hezbollah and the Houthis. Iran is an ally of Russia along with tenuous support from China amd North Korea. This is basically the axis that opposes the US. Think what would happen to the US and its interests if Israel would not get support or was conquered by its neighbours. Would that serve your interests? Ask that about Ukraine as well.

If you're an american, I don't blame you for not trusting your leaders. They don't seem to serve your interest on many other domestic issues so I get why you think they're going against your interest here too. 

In this matter though, I think it's in the interest of the US to support Israel in its fight against Hamas. You're not risking any troops like you did in other places, and you get rid of another Iranian proxy. Groups like ISIS, Al-Qaeda and Hamas tend to grow if you ignore them."

I believe every hostage alive right now can be rescued through diplomacy. But the Egyptian and Qatari position is to get out the people who have nothing to do with this and are non-combatants. The civilians should come out NOW. The captured IDF, like previously with Gilad Shalit and others, can of course be released too but that will take more time and require something from Israel that will resemble prisoner swaps.

Whole families are walled off because of association. Then, their standards of living are controlled and turned off as a way to terrorize the Palestinian citizens.

How do you prevent that from happening? Gaza was an experiment that has basically proved it wouldn't work. It was given autonomy. They had much more open borders and even their airport. And received huge amounts of development aid from abroad. And what happened? They voted for Islamic extremists (Hamas), who then killed the opposition and installed a totalitarian one-party government. They immediately started to radicalize the population, and instead of building infrastructure for their population they bought weapons and performed terrorist attacks in Israel. At the same time the population increased by 50% in 20 years only for them to complain about how they have no food.

After seeing how it went in Gaza, Israel's fear that a Palestinian state would just buy more powerful weapons on the global market to exterminate Israel is fully justified. The UN would/could do nothing against that."
k6ycrt5," No.  We already made this mistake.  When my friend's murderer was being released in the Shalit deal, we all supported it because of the ""if it saves one life"" mentality that we all had at the time.   Even my friend's MOTHER supported it.

k6ycq9v,"That's the unfortunate situation they're in.  They are a resourceful people, and they likely would get western and Israeli help.  They would need to organize first, this would have been easier before the Oct 7th Massacre.  To be honest, I'm not sure it's possible to begin at this point.  

One of the audio recordings I recently heard was a Hamas terrorist who called his parents from the phone of a woman he killed.  He called to brag to them and receive praise.  It leaves me wondering if his parents are typical of what we refer to as innocent Palestinians.  

As far as half the population being children, the number I've been hearing is 40% btw, much of that group is still of fighting age and would have to take part in any such resistance.  If they're old enough to fight for Hamas, they're old enough to resist.  I fear their schooling though works against the Palestinian people and further blurs the line between who is Hamas and who is a civilian.  

The situation is horrible all the way around.  More attacks like Oct 7th cannot and should not be tolerated.  Stopping them though, comes at a great cost.  Most of that to be felt by Palestine."

I feel confident the 9th largest army in the world can disarm Hamas or whoever *after* a peace treaty. I don't think Egypt can be helpful in disarming the WB settlers (not least of which because we don't have a land border but there are 100 other reasons :p)

I also think this will need to be a multi-year or for some parts multi-decade and tiered process. I doubt that even as rational and peace loving as we may be today, asking my parents generation (whose parents may have been killed, missing, or injured by the IDF) to automatically be friends with Israelis in 1982 would have taken a while. It takes some hard choices and sacrifices, a full generation to simmer, and then you can get people like me imho.

The Palestinians hate their oppressors. They are currently being oppressed and humiliated. I get it. But just like there were the Black Panthers and Malcom X on one side and MLK on the other, this isn't meant to be a forever hatred. Very few Black people today just *hate* white devils or whatever.

The last thing is Palestinian identity. There is one but they're not as old as Egyptian for sure. But saying there isn't one is one of the myths of the conflict.

k6yc91g,"Its less about them needing help with Hamas and more of a warning for others to not start a broader conflict. Israel security situation is very dire, they don't have the resources to sustain a long drawn out war with draft soldiers of the IDF and maintain their economy at the same time (the people running the economic output are put to war so it really hurts their econ long term).

Israel war doctrine has always been hit them fast and quick before drawing down, If attacked strike back hard as to not be on the back foot as they don't have the land/industrial capabilities for a stalemate situation and could easily be pushed out without a strong defense as the land area isn't large at all so all loses are extremely dire with little to no allies besides the US in that area surrounded by many enemies on multiple fronts."

It has always been an issue for the jewish people they have always faced persecution wherever they go. There is not 57 years of apartheid! The Arabs and UK created Nakba because Arabs thought they would win the war and they didn't so they didn't return. You can't play a fair fight loose and then cry genocide it doesn't work that way. There never was a palestinan govt and palestinan as a name was first literature in 1880 and was never self governed. They were give the ability in a 2 state solution but they started a war instead and this ongoing war has created the loss of many territories. I understand their side and how it perpetuates forever. They want the river to the sea and they never had it to begin with? So they should give up on that or they will die

Hating Israel has become a feature of faith in so many Arab communities, and we know hatred and success do not fraternize. And, no, I‚Äôm not saying the Palestinians are all terrorists. Most human beings aren‚Äôt capable of sustaining that level of dedication to hatred; but the corruption in Gaza and constant warfare and hatred and resentment is demoralizing and literally rewires the human brain.

US also gives aid to stabilize the global financial economy by allowing Israel to borrow from  the US, it keeps banking rates low. We also invest in the region to stabilize it so it isn‚Äôt completely ruled by Arab nations eg oil oil oil.

It's a large complex, apparently the main headquarters used by Hamas in Gaza.

Here is an article which details information obtained from interrogated Hamas members about the tunnel network and the practice of locating such facilities beneath hospitals and other civilian targets:

What concerns me is the narrative of the terrorist organisation Hamas is getting the overhand. People copy the side of Hamas without discussion. ""Isra√´l cuts of water and electricity and is committing genocide on Palestinians."" This is clearly not true. 
Isra√´l isn't helped with these lies, the hostages aren't helped with these lies, and even the Palestinians are not helped with these lies. The only group that is profiting from spreading these lies is Hamas.

Obviously not given by a real source since Hamas, a terrorist organization, is the one giving those numbers.

It seems like you're already taking it as a given that years down the line, future radicals living in a presumably economically strangled Gaza will be planning an attack on Israeli citizens. When that attack comes, do you think someone will say what led us here is a secondary problem, and that destroying these animalistic rapists needs to be addressed *right now*?"
k6ybale,"The footage actually RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC shows the devastation, it coincides with a very high death toll. That's why, while I take the EXACT number with a grain of salt, I believe it isn't far off.

k6yba9p,"There is a scope called ""Smart Shooter"".  You pull the trigger and aim at the general direction of the drone.

In America, Hamas is comparable to Native Americans fighting back from being placed on a reservation. Their rebellion and murdering of colonist Americans was justified. It is a black mark on our nation that we killed millions in the name of manifest destiny, and it is taught as a stain on our society.

One hundred years from now the stain of this will forever be marked on every Israeli's hands who supported this and remained silent. You will all carry the black mark. History will look back on this time and you poorly."

k6yawfh,"And if either of those things were actually happening you would be right.

The IDF have have told civilians to leave the north of Gaza. They have dropped leaflets, repeated it to media outlets for weeks. The only ones they *want* to kill in Gaza, are Hamas militants. 

On the other hand when Hamas was carrying out its attack on Oct 7th it gave no warning, killed indiscriminately and gleefully butchered civilians. Now today, they are hiding among civilians to *make* the IDF kill them. Letting their own people - their own children! - be killed. And for what? So they can use it as propaganda.

These two are not the same. It seriously worries me that so many people are unable to see past the horror in the pictures and videos that we are fed in a never-ending stream from Hamas mouthpieces like Al Jazeera, to the utter moral bankruptcy beneath. Where one side in this conflict is trying to protect their citizens, and one side is willingly using theirs as cannon fodder."

k6yarkz,"Hamas wasn't founded up until 1987-1988 so there were 30 years and Israel has been doing holocaust after holocaust and war crime after war crime, even before the Nakba, the Hagana terrorists have been killing, forcefully displacing, raping, murdering children. Don't take my word for it, watch documentaries like Tantura where Hagana talk about their atrocities.

The open air prison turned concentration camp, slowly killing its people, either by direct attacks or starving them and dehydrating them, and preventing their access to fuel and bombing the bakeries.

The argument of just targeting Hamas and telling civilians to go to the south of Gaza, has been proven false. Israel is targeting South of Gaza, as well as Targeting the West Bank where there's no Hamas.

The governments of the Western world are supporting you, but not the people. The people are aware of all the liesand propaganda being run by Israel's media and sponsored ads.

The only difference now from the 1948 Nakba is that the world is seeing your crimes, being committed live as you do them. No number of propagandas, sponsored ads and media campaigns can hide these atrocities"

k6yaql9,"Same. Look at the drone dropped grenades on the iron dome. I think he also will push for Hezbollah and Houthis to make a bigger play in the upcoming ground incursion in Gaza, whether through Iran or directly. Followed by Iran becoming more directly involved to pull even more resources to that region and away from Eastern Europe. Then he will push NK to start getting noisy again against South Korea, maybe more so than they have since the war.

k6yamkn,It‚Äôs the same tactic that was used against Jews before the holocaust. Look up Alfons Baron Luzsenszky and his book on the Talmud. Or even before the Jews Pagans in Denmark and Britain got the same treatment.
k6yamim,"Hamas is Gaza. Gaza elected them. Gaza shelters them. The thousands of Hamas troops were raised in Gazan households. Those Hamas fighters were taught to hate Israel by their families... the same families who have tried to eliminate the Jews in the area even before WW2. 

As long as the Gazans retain the will to fight there will be Hamas or some other group. 

The only way to peace is to convince the Gazans that they have no hope of overcoming Israel. In the end the only effective target to end a war is the civilian population. It's why the German cities were demolished and the Japanese nuked during WW2. It's why Genghis Khan slaughtered villages. It's why the Aztecs took hostages and sacrificed them. 

Otherwise you get situations like the constant wars in Europe during the late Middle Ages. Constant warfare that never ends with the civilian population used by those in power to constantly breed soldiers, with governments engaging in polite diplomacy that just leads to more warfare in a few years."

k6yalyt,"It's not a logic that is justifying Israel's attacks. I said, in my opinion the Israel war on Hamas is right, but I don't agree with the way it chooses to attack Gaza so far. I'm asking honestly why the world is so invested now, but don't even know that 100,000 people died in Yemen. That's a legit question."
k6yaksd,"
I don't think arguing that the Mandatory Power (British) that was the colonizer and illegitimately ""owned"" land Palestinians had been living and working on for hundreds of years is the winning argument you seem to think it is. 

Please don't confuse manufactured legislative rights with natural rights. Bar the 5-9% of land owned by Jewish people, the rest was unceded, it belonged to the local population who had inhabited the land for hundreds of years, whether they ""owned it"" outright or not.

That's the whole point of why this is wrong! Here's land the Ottomans took over from largely the ancestors of those same Palestinians and taxed but allowed Palestinians to continue to live on, and suddenly it belongs to the British Colonial power who, instead of handing it over to the people it naturally belongs to, created the circumstances to more or less eventually have it go to Israel.

Creating legislative power out of military might and the threat of violence in no way negates the inhabitants' natural rights to the land."
k6yakg2,these people are just trolls and are not worth interacting with

""Despite the economic recovery, the management of fiscal policies remained challenging as the size of the deficit before aid reached US$1.26 billion while aid hit a record low of only US$317 million in 2021. Consequently, the PA had to rely on domestic resources to finance its needs and has also been paying partial salaries since November 2021.

Economic growth and the PA‚Äôs revenues remain below potential due to movement and access restrictions, including in Area C. Palestinian external trade is controlled by Israel and is subject to costly non-tariff barriers that have reduced competitiveness. Furthermore, the Israeli closures on Gaza has resulted in an almost completely closed economy. The fiscal deficit (before aid) is expected to remain large in 2022 at 5.1% of GDP. ""

[From the world bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/09/the-palestinian-economy-will-continue-to-operate-below-potential-without-concrete-policy-actions)

""Tarik Alami, Director of the Emerging and Conflict‚ÄëRelated Issues Division of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), introduced the Secretary‚ÄëGeneral‚Äôs note on the ‚ÄúEconomic and social repercussions of the Israeli occupation on the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan‚Äù (document A/77/90‚ÄìE/2022/66).  He noted that Israel has escalated its use of force against the Palestinians, including illegal unwarranted force, amounting to arbitrary deprivation of life.

He further shared that Israel has denied Palestinians access to their natural resources, including shared water resources and an estimated 1.5 billion barrels of oil reserves in the West Bank as well as more than $2.5 billion worth of natural gas off the Gaza coast.  ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs system of policies and practices has systematically stripped the Palestinian economy of vital elements for its healthy operation, whose productive base continues to shrink, thereby exacerbating dire living conditions,‚Äù he emphasized.  The Syrian Golan has also suffered from discriminatory policies regarding land, water and zoning, he added.

The observer for the State of Palestine, noting that over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza continue to suffer from the illegal blockade, deepening poverty and unemployment, stressed that Israel continues to allow ‚Äúterrorist settlers‚Äù to kill her people in plain sight, destroying their homes and attacking their agricultural land, fruit and olive trees.  Ending the illegal occupation is key to ending the suffering of the Palestinians so they can achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, she stated, further urging the international community to fulfil its legal obligations to end the apartheid regime.""

k6yagay,"‚ÄòUN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres rightly said that the most recent violence ‚Äúgrows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year-long occupation and no political end in sight.‚Äù Various UN officials and investigative mechanisms have reaffirmed for years that Israel‚Äôs occupation of Palestinian territory ‚Äì the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza ‚Äì has been ongoing since 1967 and has no legal validity. Throughout Israel and the occupied territory, the Israeli government has imposed a two-tiered legal and political system of systematic discrimination and oppression to maintain the domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. Experts and human rights groups have recognized that this system satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for apartheid, a crime against humanity.‚Äô

‚ÄòIsraeli authorities and security forces consistently employ violence and inhumane acts targeting Palestinians, including arbitrary and extrajudicial killings, torture, the denial of fundamental rights and collective punishment. In Gaza, Israel has imposed a total blockade by air, land and sea since 2007, inflicting an ongoing humanitarian crisis on 2.3 million Palestinians living in what many have characterized as the world‚Äôs largest ‚Äúopen-air prison.‚Äù In the Occupied West Bank, illegal settlement expansion has escalated. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 789 Palestinian-owned structures have already been demolished or seized by Israeli government authorities so far in 2023. In recent years, plans for thousands of housing units have been advanced to expedite settlement expansion, effectively guaranteeing that the occupied territory will remain under Israeli control in perpetuity. Under the Geneva Conventions, settlement expansion is a war crime.‚Äô

That's a surefire way to get a rpg / mortar round in your face. They're not targeting civilians. If they did, Hamas wouldn't be using them as shields or hiding its HQ beneath a hospital.

No one was falsely imprisoned for protesting because Israel is a democratic state, shocking, right?

Those who were taken by the police were either released after a day or have been imprisoned or put in a house arrest for using violence in the protests (from both sides).

Parading naked bodies (Alive or unconscious) around the town square while regular civilians cheer? That‚Äôs a special type of degeneration. 

The more Palestinians think like you and pursue armed resistance‚Ä¶ The more their quality of life will be reduced.

You also don‚Äôt seem to accept the level of hatred from Muslims towards Jews‚Ä¶ Proceeding this conflict by over 1000 years. They aren‚Äôt fighting for freedom dude, it‚Äôs a murderous death cult!"

The Palestinian Authority is corrupt and ineffectual, and IDF has to go in and disarm the militants that pose a threat to the peace of Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank. The alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia was going to be an effort to impose more order in the West Bank, very much something Iran could not allow. Iran is desperate to become a nuclear power aligned with Russia, China and North Korea (FWTW). Israel will always be a hindrance to Iran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions, thus the hatred. The Palestinians are the pawns in the game to manipulate the West and a constant source of terrorists and violence. Authoritarianism is the rule in the Middle East because there isn‚Äôt a real grasp of democracy or freedom and whenever there is, the extremists show up to turn over the apple cart. The West may never figure this out because we are incredibly clueless about culture and history and human nature itself.

Lol.

Western media doesn't care if Turkey is secular or theocratic. They only care if Turkey is working for American interests or not. Back in the days, western media used to regard Kemalists as ""Islamophobes"", who oppressed religion and Erdoƒüan as a great muslim liberator, an example to rest of muslim world. Of course he was subservient to the West in this period. Erdoƒüan was given as example as how leadership in the rest of Muslim world should be. American media was even pushing the idea of Turkey finally joining the EU.

Turkey's negative coverage started when Erdoƒüan's policies started to drift away from American interests. Particularly with the war against Gulenists (CIA project) and involvement in Syria. Nothing to do with his internal policies at all.

Even today, Western media determined the ""heroes"" fighting against Erdoƒüan's backward government to be, liberals and leftists. They are the ones covered primarily in Westen media, despite being a tiny demographic. (Also pro-PKK Kurds) While Kemalists who are actually the main opposition to Erdoƒüan never have their voices heard in Western media.

This is the demographic America wants to see ruling Turkey post-Erdoƒüan, as they're most likely to be subservient. They receive enormous amounts of funds from Western NGOs.

This is also why you won't see countries like Saudi Arabia or Turkmenistan being criticized in mainstream Western media, as they have ""good relations"" with USA."

People don't understand how powerful the US military is when fully brought to bear.

Just for one example: there are 21 heavy aircraft carriers in the world, and the USA has 11 of them. Everyone else only has two at most. The US airforce is the biggest airforce in the world. The second is the US Army. The Fourth is the US Navy and the Seventh is the US Marine Corps.

As Iraq found out in 1991, turning 50% of your enemies airspace by volume to steel and high explosive is a tactic most countries can't deal with.

Israel left Gaza.
It was to give them a chance to build their own state.
The assumption was that since Israel has done so, the world would be critical to any attack coming from Gaza.
Israel gave peace a chance, and the first thing the Palestinians did with it was to attack Israel and increase their military power.
And your hypocrisy is so outrageous, because the entire world - Europe and the US, not only they advocated that move, but also they gave guarantees to back Israel in the case of being attacked by the Palestinians from Gaza.
Of course, no backing came after the first, second or third attack on Israel.
For two whole years, the Palestinians got their freedom in Gaza from any occupation, blockade etc.
During that time, NaziHamas was elected ( openly stating it aims to kill Jews), rockets were fired from Gaza to Israel, terror attacks on the border in which a soldier was kidnapped by NaziHamas and absolutely nothing to build their homeland.
And what was the answer from Europe and the US? Nothing.
Israel is on its own.

So where does all this lead us? Nowhere. The whole ethnic ownership of the land thing is just what the founding Zionists, who were themselves mostly not religiously Jewish, used as an excuse to justify stealing the Palestinian land from its natives. The fact is wherever they originated from, the Muslim Arab Palestinians had lived IN Palestine since at least the Umayyad Caliphate 1300 years ago consecutively until 1948 when European Zionists came and kicked them out. They had always identified as Arab and lived side by side with Palestinian Jews and Christians and it wasn't a problem until the Zionists made it a problem.

k6y99ek,"There's no open field battles like in Ukraine. Hamas/PIJ is guerilla fighting from within civilian infrastructure. No more roof-knocking in Northern Gaza either, it's been weeks of evacuation notices. Israel was always painted as aggressive, brutal force. Now there's plenty of reasons to take the gloves off. Not unlike in Mosul when ISIS was being cleared from there."
k6y98w3,"It's simple. Israel is just not supposed to defend itself. It's perfectly OK for Israel to be attacked because they're the obvious bad guys.

And if an Israeli civilian gets killed by a rickey every now and again then that's just what you get for living in Israel...

It's really telling that these massive protests weren't happening last year but they are happening now that Hamas has murdered many innocent civilians.

I wonder how Americans would react to seeing massive Taliban rallies in other countries after 9/11."
k6y98od,They do that anyway lol since when have there ever been any repercussions
k6y97qb,"Think about it for a second:  Is anybody sending journalists to count bodies in Gaza?  Hamas is the only one that can give a number, and they have every reason to inflate that number as much as possible. Why would they tell the truth? WHo is fact checking them? Do you think they have any problem lying about something like that? Al Jazeera is just publishing the number Hamas is giving them.  If you think I am wrong, please give me another explanation. 

As for Hamas killing it's own people, first off nobody said that they did, they just made up a number, Secondly, Yeah, Hamas would totally kill it's own people:

k6y9403,"&gt;The first 36 hours

I'd say it's even less honestly. Most terrorists returned to Gaza after about 10 or 12 hours of non-stop mass murder, the other who stayed for a full day were those who closed themselves off in the police station in Sderot and those who were fortified in houses in Be'eri and other kibbutzim.

Basically I'm pretty sure the murder/hour ratio of Hamas is even bigger."
k6y93z1,"People did , ots just hamas does brutally crack down on already demonstrations, and hamas is known to throw peoole they dont like or see as threat, frpm buildings. 

How the hell would they throw hamas out.

And israel didnt exactlyoffer palistinians anyhelp, the opposite, they did al√∂ow the idf to do heinous things to palestinian civilians  with the excuse of "" its hamas"".

So how would they force put hamas, an organisation whose very violence i think agree on is heinous.  Which pa√∂estinians see too. And dobt have a military to fight against.

Plus the idf rather than being any help,is busy opressing, harassing, or just straight up killing civilians, which i fail to see how doea help

Too bad for both. Other people and nations can be dumb and hate each other without bombing each other. Set up two nations, get the UN to police the border and oversee an international city of Jerusalem as was laid out decades ago by the UN, and let people hate each other as long as they don't kill each other."
k6y93kh,"Your heart is in the right place I think.  I disagree with some of what you said though.   There are millions of Arabs in dozens of countries.   There is no genocide going on against Arabs or Palestinians.   Hamas yes; wipe them out.  In regards to the value of life. Fine. Now where are the western protests against Muslim-cleansing in Burma, China, and India?  Non-existent.  When the Jews stand up for themselves; people who normally think rationally lose their minds. 

Regardless in the big picture, Iran wins.   And Iran played Israel and the Arab world like a fiddle.   Now Saudi-Israel normalization is off and Iran's chances of secretly building an atomic bomb went up.

Once the Iranian loonies get a bomb, tiny Israel as a fake enemy won't seem so bad in retrospect."

Israel has no other way cleansing Gaza from Hamas isis rather than attacking from above these type of buildings, because you can rest assure no country would just send their troops to a highly mined buildings like that blindly, the only real solution is pushing out civilians from these mines buildings, and taking them down from above. You fear from not enough reports? Israel afraid from a 3rd holocaust in the future like 07/10/23 and WW2.

Japan's merchant Marine was actually incapable of meeting all their shipping needs before the war, and they relied substantially on the British and Swedish merchant Marines to meet their demand. For a country that's a net food importer, you'd think that was a serious concern but they did it anyway. 

There have been lots of conflicts where there were concrete, known, predictable reasons why peace and trade were superior to war, and the people involved chose war anyway. Even in cases where close trade ties have existed for decades, that can change very quickly."

When they returned to their homeland, there was opportunity for peace.  Right up until the Arabs attacked (Again and again and again).  In fact, there continue to be opportunities for peace.  Such as the peace talks that the Hamas attacks interrupted, the Abraham Accords.

Hamas doesn't want peace, Hamas simply wants the territory, and I'd argue if they achieve that goal, they won't stop, they'll continue on to eradicate all Jews, just like was called for in their original charter.

Palestine voted Hamas into office.  I'll give you that rising up is risky, but not rising up is also risky.  That is a standard, BTW, I hold all people to.  Keep your government in check so another nation doesn't need to.

BTW, I don't take a neutral stance.  I generally stand with Israel. They have a right to the territory they are on.  In fact, biblically speaking, their territory should be much larger."

Hamas broke the peace. Hamas brags about raping, torturing and executing innocent, unarmed civilians. Hamas has taken unarmed men, women, elderly and children as hostages. Hamas purposefully inflicts cruelty upon people they KNOW are innocent, non-combatants.

IDF kills civilians too. But they do so because Hamas are purposefully setting up their military assets in areas that will cause the most collateral damage.

You can freely criticize both but let's not act like they're remotely the same. Hamas is a terrorist group. The IDF is a military force responding to a war they didn't start."

No Western nation has explicitly supported and cheered on what's been done in those other conflicts. It makes sense people want to resist what their governments are doing in this case."
k6y809z,Hasbara. Also be wary of people who are pretending to be Arabs here.
k6y804e,"Could you name these many massacres that happened against Arabs before the 1920s?

I am not Israeli or Jewish.

Most people aren't just wanting to live on their land. After Palestinians separated from Egypt, Jordan, Syria etc and made their own governments, the Oslo agreements were meant as a route towards statehood, and the Israelis were happy for that. 

The problem was there was (and still is) widespread support, especially among the young, to use violence against civilians to push negotiations. Fatah, and probably Hamas more recently, believed that they could use violence to get better concessions from Israel, and that that was the only language they understood. So, they killed civilians, built up arms, and prepared for war.

Israelis saw that as Palestinians preparing to invade Israel, and used force to stop them and escalated control of them to stop terrorism.

So long as Palestinians support armed struggle against Israel, they'll have a bad time."

I am a leftist Zionist, you bigot. But I am also Jewish and I can recognize an anti-Semite. And the comparison you made is anti-Semitic.

I'd stop bombing, beg the civilians of Palestine for forgiveness, and engrave it in law that my settlers should never again be allowed to set foot in Palestinian homes without their permission again and vice versa. No more forced evictions so Israeli settlers can move in, no more rape and murder of Palestinians going about their day for the crime of being Palestinians. Equal rights. 

You are talking about the West Bank, completely forgetting Arab guilt, okay. But I didn't ask you what you would do with the West Bank. I asked you what you would do with Gaza, which since it is free to govern itself has turned into a den of bloodthirsty terrorists who behead children just because they are Jewish. What would you do to stop Hamas violence that does not stem from settler violence, since there has not even been a shadow of settlers in Gaza for 20 years.

If Israel destroys Hamas, another Hamas will emerge out of it. It is delusional to think that the ideology will die down, simply because huge portion kf the population believes in historical injustices + bombs are falling on their heads. 

If someone tries to justify bombing of civilians, or mentions elections in Gaza in 2007, it is not relevant in this point imo. 

Whether the bombing is justified or not, it will push more people into extremism. 

Considering elections, that is an illusory and reductionistic view on the complexity of a population's political aspirations. 

Am I saying they support or don't support Hamas? I dont know, and I cannot judge based on some polls, nobody can convince that those things paint the true picture of the complexity. 

How can we know about the validity of those elections? Do we know for sure if there was not intimidation, blackmail or brainwashing? (it happens in my country a whole lot)

&gt;They are carpet bombing an entire city because a few people in that city did something they don't like.

IDF dosnt have the military capability to carpet bomb

&gt;No matter how much you try to justify it the fact remains that the IDF is killing innocent civilians 100x more than they are killing Hamas

False. Hamas reported 8k dead people in Gaza since the start of the war. Assuming the numbers arent fake (as we learned in the hospital bombing incident), and assuming theyre all civilians and not at all Hamas terrorist, its still only less than 6 time more than Israeli casualties. Nevertheless dont expect eye-for-eye as this war target is to elliminate Hamas and defend Israel, from all sides, no matter what it takes.

&gt;Leveling an entire Apartment complex because 1 Hamas agent is hiding in it is not a justification.

Yes it is. And in addition, Israel have been warning Gazans for weeks to gtfo south

&gt;If they truly wanted to eliminate Hamas while not committing war crimes they would go in boots on the ground. But since the IDF is made up of cowards not soldiers they will never do that.

Who are you little turd to decide how an army should win in war? Additionally to your bullshit, all states are against Israel making ground moves so stop the hypocrisy. And even then, no kne will dictate to another nation''s army of to defend itself, thus Israel is making ground moves, contradicting your statement.

&gt;Warfare involves soldiers fighting against soldiers

Wow I didnt know Israeli babies, children and elders among other civilians qualified as soldiers and theyre ok to be targeted

&gt;That is not a war

Yes it is, again you make stupid declerations.
Israel will win for the sake of its existance



&gt;I have seen hundreds of video's of dead children being pulled from the rubble but I have yet to see a single Hamas soldier be killed in these attacks,

1. All the child videos you see are probably Pallywood. Just like the girl who been rescued 3 times, the corpse playing a mobile phone between sets and many other fakes.
2. Look at IDF publications for Hamas leaders death list

&gt;Was Hamas hiding in the church? Were they hiding in the Hospital? Are they hiding in the children's school?

Yes, yes and yes

&gt;To my knowledge Hamas has never done anything of the sort but the IDF has done this dozens of times. 

Yea we understood your knowledge is extremly lacking.

&gt;The IDF intentionally targets children because children represent the future of the Palestinian people

Hamas uses them as human shields. Even UNRWA confirmed that

&gt;Did Hamas ever bomb a hospital?

3 times in this war actually: 2 time an Israeli one and 1 time Gazan one if you count PIJ and Hamas together

&gt;Did the IDF? Yes

Not yet, but since IDF published intel reveling Shifaa hospital is Hamas quarters, they warned the hospital the evacuate an I assume they will begin exterminating the facilities

&gt;It seems to me that this ""response"" is way too far coming from the Israeli si

Who are you to decide how a country defend itself? The threat will be removed, this is the war goal.

&gt;Hamas fired a few home made rockets made out of water pipes so that gives Israel the right to use million dollar munitions, gifted by the most powerful country in the world to level an entire block

Yes. A weapon is a weapon. If I want to kill you with a hommade weapon, youre not allowed to defend youself with standard weapon?

Ofcourse they will fight back (in some cases ruthlessly), This is basic social mechanisms and group behaviour. 

What is more, the early Jewish immigration wasn't exactly peaceful either, they were armed and later on formed militas and they themselves did insane acts of violence which in the 40s was in the level of a war-crime level directed to mostly civilian arabs. (Tantura for example)

The only reason the response is not disproportionate is because the IDF isn't kidnapping 230 hostages that include women and children from their homes in Gaza, not beheading them, not raping them, etc, etc.The response right now is a very very fair response conducted by a law-abiding country even though they have suffered through crimes against humanity. The only ones you can blame for the Palestinian casualties are Hamas which use their people as human shields. The fact that you can't acknowledge that the corrupt leaders of the Palestinians are the reason for the Palestinian plight shows that you know so little about the conflict.

....right...I guess there is some kind of timer on how long it takes until decades of ethnic cleansings are no longer relevant to a people. Hmm interesting. I'll uhh meditate on that one. It's not like 2023 had the most Palestinian casualties from Israel aggression since 2005 or earlier IIRC.

\&gt;Building materials are being diverted to be used for Hamas tunnels. That's why Israel is limiting the influx of materials. There are several cement factories in Gaza however.

That doesn't change how your average Palestinian lives on a day to day basis. [They literally have to work in half destroyed factories](https://youtu.be/hw4CH-Jg6lY?t=193) to keep themselves going. That is, if they are amongst the minority of people lucky enough to have a job.

\&gt;Hamas themselves outlawed the digging of new wells and dug up water pipes to create rockets.

That is such a disingenuous representation of historical fact you cannot actually be serious.

""The legacy of Israel‚Äôs 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories has been systematic human rights violations on a mass scale. One of its most devastating consequences is the impact of Israel‚Äôs discriminatory policies on Palestinians‚Äô access to adequate supplies of clean and safe water.

Soon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 50 years on, Israel continues to control and restrict Palestinian access to water in the OPT to a level which neither meets their needs nor constitutes a fair distribution of shared water resources.

In November 1967 the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158, which stated that Palestinians could not construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. Since then, the extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure would require permits from Israel, which are near impossible to obtain. Palestinians living under Israel‚Äôs military occupation continue to suffer the devastating consequences of this order until today. They are unable to drill new water wells, install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and fresh water springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry.""

\- from [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)

Why don't you explain WHY Hamas banned the free drilling of wells? Because their underground aquifier was being contaminated. They didn't ban it btw, they started licensing it, because people could freely dig wells without regulation and it was making the groundwater undrinkable, as well as they were facing a groundwater deficit. They have a very limited supply of water, thanks to Israeli oppression, so it needs to be regulated.

There are definitely legitimate concerns about how that money will be used be a clearly corrupt group like Hamas. But the bottom line is this problem exists because of decades of water insecurity as imposed by Israel.

There is good reason why there are literally people who study the Holocaust for a career [calling out Israel's actions as genocidal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWGGjLZNuyg&amp;t=332s&amp;ab_channel=DemocracyNow%21)"

Even if it were true that Hamas maintains this, that doesn't necessarily mean the only possible response is to kill all of Hamas, which is an ideology as much as a group of people.

[Hamas has asked for a trade](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjv5rrqz6) of all Israeli hostages for all Palestinian ""prisoners"" (many effectively hostages: held for decades without trial). If Israel accepted that trade, [as the families of the hostages want](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-28/ty-article/.premium/hostages-families-tell-netanyahu-releasing-palestinian-prisoners-is-only-option/0000018b-77b0-d1da-a1bb-7fb80e600000), it would do quite a bit to calm the situation both there and internationally. 

Then Israel could signal to the Palestinian Authority a renewed interest and need for peace negotiations. The UN could oversee these talks and eventually oversee the process for a two-state solution. Gaza would be absorbed into this new nation and Hamas, as an ideology, would lose support.

There, I solved the crisis without having to bomb hospitals and children to ""get rid of Hamas"" with literally no plans for the day after."

k6y5yhs,"Israeli left wing here!

Personally I tend to divide this issue into 2 parts because it is quite complex:

1.  Government dealing with the occupation. (first a little reminder that only the WB is occupied, Gaza is an independent territory thet relies on Israel and I'll get back to that later.)

So there is a current military occupation in the west bank. for them, it means that they have their own governing body but cannot have an army. While I do understand Israel's decision to do this, I think that the Idf often take it too far and often use too much violence (those are most of the stories you read on that site). This is what me and the majority of the left wing are against!!!

we believe that a left wing government can avoid the useless violence and work to quiet down the area until there can be proper conversations about peace and a Palestinian state. we want to stop that violence!!!

(but anyone who says that the occupation should immediately leave- does not understand the situation, because right now the years of violence have led the WB to a point where they WILL try to destroy Israel instead of living peacefully beside it. Both countries need some peaceful cool-down tome beforehand.)

2. Israel protecting itself.

as I've stated before, while there is too much violence and silencing on the WB, and that can be dealt with,

Gaza is a completely different story. They're an independent territory: Israel does NOT enter that territory on a regular basis, and therefore they do not use violence or silencing. during ""peacetime"" Israel actually helps Gaza by providing them with electricity and water,

yet somehow the Gazan citizens still scream occupation, so in this situation I (and the majority of the left wing) support Israel and its defence."

k6y5w1j,"""Now"" America has not built a colony in Japan; Japan is Japanese. Many decades have passed since the perpetration of the hurt. America did not *continue* to mercilessly inflict suffering on the Japanese by camping out in Japan and refusing to leave This is a false equivalency. 

Not only this, *even if* the comparison were appropriate (if America had colonized Japan, made them into second-class citizens and annexed some of the land as they tried to resist) and then the Japanese found a way to be okay with it, that would still just be Japan's choice. 

It wouldn't take anything away from the Palestinians' right to resist. If someone comes and robs my house, my innate reaction would be to run out the back door. In that scenario, nobody gets hurt. But if someone chooses to stand their ground and beat up the intruder, that reaction is valid too, and it doesn't give the intruder the right to pull out a gun and shoot the homeowner. 

And then try to spin a narrative about how they're the victim because the homeowner attacked them as they were committing a felony. 

The reclamation of their land was not the only platform Hamas ran on. They promised schools and a level of economic prosperity to the people. Second, it's 100% valid for them to elect a party whose intention is to resist the occupation of their land. 

Israel is the occupier here. It is valid and ethical to resist that occupation..."
k6y5une,"Good question. 

Iran's hand.  By provoking a heavy response from Israel, the warming of relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran's other enemy, and Israel are now dead.

I have friends on both sides and have been to these areas. And have even been to gaza strip. I have friends on both sides.

Stop listening to warmongers on the internet considering they do not have to actually go through this war like us. It‚Äôs okay to be mad about what happened, but be understanding as well and look at the WHY this is happening. And I know the warmongers will say ‚ÄúBUT HAMAS IS WHY ITS HAPPENING‚Äù. Hamas is a result of Israeli government and their actions.

What we need to do, for the safety of everyone over there, is eliminate the NEED for hamas. Because all these guys think destroying an area with 2 million people will fix everything, when historically you just piss more people off and create more terror.

If Gaza is leveled, the entire Middle East will become hostile to you. The Middle East will put heavy sanctions on you. And Americans military is not what it used to be post Iraq war, despite what these guys will tell you. The US can‚Äôt protect you guys forever, and TBH most people here don‚Äôt want to be over there at all.

It‚Äôs better for everyone if the international community steps in, forces Bibi and his friends to resign. And ends this. Or else there will be no Israel. America simply cannot win against the entire Middle East, Russia, and China.

We are all feeling loss right now. And we are all angry. We need to do what Rabin was doing before a far right Benjamin Netanyahu supporter killed him.

And don‚Äôt listen to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have anything invested over there. These guys who suggest war can watch it from their phones and sleep soundly at night. They aren‚Äôt going to be losing their homes and families if this turns out bad.

They say that ‚ÄúPalestinians don‚Äôt want peace‚Äù well we were getting pretty peaceful during Rabins prime ministry. Palestinians don‚Äôt hate all Israelis. They hate Zionist. I know Palestinians and Israelis that work together here in the US. It‚Äôs the Israeli government, not you guys.

Sorry but attempting to be analytical while failing to mention the context is absolutely tone-deaf from you. Try better next time with your seemingly nonsensical, neutralist attitude towards this whole thing, as it makes you sound insensitive to human suffering. Children, tragically, in their thousands, have died. So, asking them to revolt is convenient for you while also not acknowledging the decades of history of Israel brutally denying them of human rights and controlling every aspect of their lives. Let's not even get into the average age of a Gazan. So, it's pretty much absurd to buy into this IDF ""self-defense"" rhetoric and how they're pretty much 100% victims in all this. I can link you to multiple sources of atrocities committed by IDF and the countless breaking of international laws if you're curious. Lastly, you can definitely recognize a government's faults while still appreciating one's culture and traditions. It's not hard to grasp

 **or small arms fire to be twice as deadly as aerial bombing of a dense city, either it was particularly brutal, or the aerial bombing is taking drastic steps to avoid death.**   


This pretty much says nothing. Comparing the rate of innocent lives lost like they're statistic to prove a point is a dehumanized way of looking into this. Civilians should never be targeted period. Justifying and basically condemning thousands because ""hamas"" entrenched themselves (some arent even provided with proof) is absolutely evil. You should be ashamed of yourself into trying to redirect the suffering and making it solely about Isreal, and minimizing the tragedies that are happening"

Billions of dollars of foreign humanitarian aid has been squandered to build tunnels, bombs, and missiles, instead of economic development.

There is also a religious justification but I don't care about it and online trolls use that as a strawman to argue Israel shouldn't exist so why give them the opportunity.

I don't want Gaza to be bombed either nor do I want innocent Palestinians dead. Unfortunately, I recognize Hamas uses them as human shields to push its narrative and it is literally inevitable, even when tremendous effort is made to avoid it, to not harm civilians in a process of eliminating Hamas.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Even expressing that opinion in Israel is a hot take. A lot of my friends who were leftists are calling for destruction of Gaza since 10/7.

I, nor any of my leftist friends, agree with you that it's a ""hot take"". It's a genuine humane 'take' and I don't know anyone who would doubt it or argue with you about it. Emotions are running high but I don't know anyone who thinks that Palestinians don't deserve to live or that they're all terrorists, end of discussion. I acknowledge that might be thanks to my environment, so lets look at the media- Not one media channel in Israel considers all Palestinians terrorists, nor does anyone call for their destruction.

I'm not denying the IDF has committed what can be described as war crimes, yet calling an entire organization, made up of Israelis like you and me, evil? That's idiotic to say the least. If you're actually an Israeli who has served in the IDF, you should know better.Doing ""hasbara"" online feels like an uphill battle but the only reason people are so pro Palestinian is because for decades Israel has put zero effort in presenting its side of the story to the world.

Reality doesn't conform to intellectuals' ideas and ideals. 

As for Israeli hasbara, of course they'd utter phrases like that. ""There's 22 Arab countries, why can't the Palestinians just relocate?""  The presence of 22 Arab political entities doesn't give a group of nativist, militant Jews the right to uproot non-Jewish people (Palestinians in this case) and expel them. It doesn't give them the right to steal houses and farmland.

That's the last line of defence for right-wing Zionists, shouting anti-Semitism whenever someone says that MAYBE Israel escalated the conflict beyond repair by killing ~10,000 Palestinians. I'm simply anti-apartheid. 

What would I do? I would bloody try. I'd stop bombing, beg the civilians of Palestine for forgiveness, and engrave it in law that my settlers should never again be allowed to set foot in Palestinian homes without their permission again and vice versa. No more forced evictions so Israeli settlers can move in, no more rape and murder of Palestinians going about their day for the crime of being Palestinians. Equal rights."

k6y4vuw,"Man, are you ever misinformed. First, yes, the Jews were ‚Äúcreated‚Äù in one place. Just check out the archeological evidence. They laid claim to that land long before anyone else. They also constantly kept coming back to it, even when it was occupied by other powers. Being Semitic has nothing to do with anything. If you want to get recent, they were there in the 1800s and early 1900s. They were always there. The Arabs were nomads, they were never a unified people. The term Palestinian only came into existence in the ‚Äò60s. It‚Äôs not even an Arabic word. The Romans gave it to the locals. When the land was ruled by the British, they partitioned it, and gave the Arabs a part of it. THEY REFUSED! Why do all the pro Palestinians conveniently overlook this fact? They were even given a part of Jerusalem! And they refused! You say you‚Äôre not antisemitic. But do you not understand what is at the heart of the matter? They want the annihilation of Israel! How is that okay? They were offered a two state solution over and over again. If you‚Äôre going to fight someone, you have to be prepared to lose, and against all odds, the Arab nations did lose. Why do you also not see the need for a buffer between Israel and its enemies? In North America, you simply put up a fence between you and your neighbor and you consider that a buffer. But I‚Äôd like to know what kind of buffer you would consider acceptable if that neighbor threw a bomb into your backyard. All Israel ever wanted was peace. You seem to conveniently forget that they walked the talk with Egypt a long time ago. Once Sadat recognized Israel‚Äôs right to exist, Israel immediately gave them back the Sinai. What exactly are you looking for here? For them to stop the bombing and let Hamas continue unchecked? Are you looking for proportionality? Hamas slaughtered 1400 Jews so Israel should go in and find 1400 Palestinians to slaughter? That‚Äôs not how it works.

Which it could have totally avoided were it the genocidal entity you accuse it of being.
Instead, it's built the Iron Dome system to protect our people from most but by no means all of the missiles, and developed ever more accurate bombs to minimize to the extent possible harm to civilians.
You heard of the bombings of Dresden and Tokyo in WWII -- by the allies?! Israel could have easily flattened the Gaza Strip if it were to follow the Allies' script, and the Gaza problem would be over.

The Palestinian cause is close to my heart. My heart breaks at seeing their non stop oppression for 75 years. I oppose the actions of Israel to carpet bomb them, I oppose the violence, humiliation, fear and terror that settlers inflict on Palestinians, not just in Gaza but on the west bank. Of this, there are many Israeli soldiers who have left the army because they couldn't bear to continue committing atrocities. This will never mean I believe Israelis are evil or deserve anything but to be treated with compassion and empathy as we ask for Palestinians. 

There is so much pain, so much horror. Asymmetrical horror, but it does not mean it does not feel deep within those who are suffering from this situation. 

I hope you and your family are safe and I fight in my little ways to make sure that israelians and jews are not equated to the Israeli government,  and that Palestinians are not equated to Hamas."

If the list exists remotely, the extension could grab that list and store it locally. That would be the only request to an external resource that you'd need.

This might hold the stick from the middle temporarily until you're able to open-source it. In that case, privacy-concerned individuals can then inspect the outgoing traffic themselves to verify that no server calls are taking place with the exception of the original request to populate the list."

Another source: the actual TONS of raw unedited footage released to the public of rows upon rows and rooms full of dead bodies, collapsed buildings with bodies emerging from the rubble, people being buried.

k6y4b7r,"&gt; This is speculation. It hasn't actually happened, even by the current far right coalition.

Every single proposal from Israel demanded settlements as part of Israel - Only expection from this is Olmert.

Why do you think negotiations fail? Because Israel wants that settler land and Palestinians refuse.

---

&gt; I'm saying they're hated because most people in Israel don't like violence. 

Which means Israeli support ""nice settlers"" and dont oppose colonialism. 

---

&gt; Where did I imply it was a PR issue?

You implied it by explaining that there are also ""nice settlers"".


---

&gt; You do understand that there were ancient Jewish communities in the west bank, like in east Jerusalem and Hebron that were ethnically cleansed during the Nakba, right?

The fact that you use refugees as a tool to defend settlers is disgusting. 

Also do you apply the same logic to 700k palestinians that were expulsed too? 

Do you support right to return? 

---

&gt; Imagine telling a Jew who can trace their roots countless generations in Jerusalem that they're ""colonizing"" it.

We are talking about settlers outside Jerusalem. Jerusalem itself is completly different beast. 



---

&gt; Regardless, why can't two indigenous communities live in a country called Palestine, together?

For two reasons:

1. Many settlements are built on stolen or confiscated land left after palestinians fleed

2. Israel only wants annexation of Settlements in agreement

If course, it is doable. But one side doesnt wa t that.

Many still don't, frankly, and I'm no expert myself, but nuance is seemingly lost on many people. Social media has caused news of the conflict to reach a much broader range of people, too, while pushing short, sensationalized content. It's created a shitstorm of half baked hot takes instead of real information."
k6y4agr,"No Israeli authenticated or goverment-funded force as been actively targeting, hurting and hunting down innocent civilians as much as hamas does on both sides and that is just a fact. Israel has encountered and dismantled numerous terrorist organizations over the years, whether these are secretly or publicly commited organizations, while keeping civilian casualties as low as possible, respective of their causes. Tell me this: why is the Hamas blantly trying to get their civilians to stay in area Israeli forces tell them to evacuate, despite knowing the great danger they're putting them in, instead of using their resources (which they steal from 3rd-party-founded programs made to specifically help their citizens have a better living quality) to help evacuate those in danger? Because these people are their political meat shield. Those in power, in the charge of the Hamas don't see them as people, they see them as political power, that's why."

2. I'm guessing that you are suggesting that there were victims of friendly fire - this sort of information becomes public after a probe post war. This was the case in all recent wars, post Yom Kippur. During the fighting little criticism is voiced, but after - the truth (or most of it) will come out. So just like we had the Winograd Commission, Kahan Commission and the Agranat Commission, I hope we'll know the truth with a Commission here as well.

And surprisingly Israel were actually the first ones to give Palestine their own country, Egypt and Jordan sure weren‚Äôt planning on it and they turned down the UNs offer.

It is only due to the tolerance, patience and understanding of the free world that Palestinians are still treated so well.

k6y40vb,User name is correct. Stupid something.
k6y40un,"I guess I can understand that having been oppressed for decades, *some* Palestinians (not all and certainly not the majority) may look to the resources they feel they have to find avenues for their (legitimate) hatred of Israelis. Being unsophisticated, uneducated, etc., and relying on what are certainly racist chants doesn't mean the *CORE* and *source* of the Palestinian stance is antisemitic. 

It is inconceivable to look at this situation and say, the real reason Palestinians hate Israelis is that they're antisemitic. It's far, far more likely they hate Israelis because they've been brutally colonized, oppressed, dehumanized and murdered by them. 

When we look at how muted the Palestinian response to demographic engineering of Palestine was via the Mandate for Palestine, we understand it's very unlikely that antisemitism is the core of their problem with Israelis. 

The main issue is that the establishment of Israel and Israelis has been nothing but a complete catastrophe for them. Their responses since then have been valid responses. There's again no need to dehumanize them; the only Jewish people they've had contact with are the Israeli Jews who've been absolutely terrible to them. Of course they chant these things!

That doesn‚Äôt justify it, but that‚Äôs literally why. Weird. You keep trying zo play the victim, but as far as I can see, Jews were not persecuted in the middle east for many centuries. It was always the christians in Europe that had a problem with them.

k6y3d93,"&gt; I assume it was mostly a surprise that no arab nation directly intervene because of the US.

No, nation states in the region wouldn't have intervened anyway. A couple of reasons for that:

* Israel has nukes, they do not.
* It takes a considerable amount of time to build up for an invasion.
* None of the Arab armies can take on the IDF and while they are very inept, they know that much.
* They have more to lose than to gain from attacking Israel directly.
* Making a scene at the UN and holding a few speeches is cheap, easy, risk- and consequence-free while satisfying most of their riled-up citizens."

k6y389r,"It is ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù. And I will give you the simple reason without you tossing and turning at night trying to figure it out.

Religion. Islam is what Hamas uses to order the Palestinians around. They use allah‚Äôs words, Mohammad‚Äôs words, all written and documented. They don‚Äôt need to make it up. Islam is antisemitic. It teaches muslims that jews are not their friends. It asks muslims to start ‚Äújihad‚Äù against the ‚Äúenemies of god‚Äù . Tells them in detail that war for this land will stay till the end of time, until muslims kill every last jew.

Hamas preaches these words of allah, over and over. They say Israel wants to tear down al Aqsa, for 38 years i have heard this.. nothing‚Äôs getting touched.. yet they keep saying the same lie and people get triggered. They call Palestinians the ‚Äú only arabs fighting for the honor of the muslim nation ‚Äú. Reminds them that if and when they die for this ‚Äúcause‚Äù they go straight to heaven, no questions asked. Like they hold the keys.

Notice every mother‚Äôs reaction to her slayn children in Gaza.. she says ‚Äúnothing‚Äôs too much for god and al Aqsa‚Äù. They truly believe, poor naive things, that they are living the word of allah.. waiting for the time he allows them to finally beat the jews.

It‚Äôs ridiculous. It‚Äôs worse than hypnosis. They are completely blind to any logic outside of what they‚Äôve been consistently hearing from the day they were born. 

You know how I know that this is 100% true?

My own parents have these exact thoughts. Luckily we don‚Äôt live there. And more lucky for me that I have the brains to not fall for that hypnosis."

k6y34bm,"I've given your question some thought. Here's my understanding of the situation, and I'll break this down into three reasons:  
1. Why I don't think that the Israeli government is generally interested in any escalation:  
A. This isn't in Bibi's interest - the Israeli PM for decades has been running on two platforms. He is sold as Mr. Security and Mr. Finance.  The way the former is measured by, is (quite literally) the number of Israeli deaths due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. News outlets often run [comparisons between PMs](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001407799) by looking at [Israeli deaths as as criterion for measuring effective governance](https://natunbarosh.co.il/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95-%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C/) (obviously, the less death, the better).   
B. This isn't in the coalition's interest - the past year in Israel has been marked by the judicial reform and the entire coalition has been geared towards ensuring the passing of this legislation. Members of the Knesset spent time, money and resources campaigning in favour and against this issue. This was going to be Bibi's big win and a lot was riding on the success of this law. I don't think that the coalition was interested in a military escalation at all, as all the funds, energy and efforts were directed elsewhere for a very long time.  
2. Even if you don't buy into the first point, I don't think that the Israeli government is interested in this scale of an escalation:  
A. A lot of the areas that were hit, are key agricultural points in Israel, directly affecting food supplies and agricultural exports.  
B. Terrorists have made it into secure and highly protected bases, almost stealing extremely classified information (it is clear that this was the intention.  
C. Blatant murder of hundreds of any Israeli is a mark of Cain on any Israeli politicians. You can see how well Olmert faired after the second Lebanon war and operation Cast Led, and how Golda went down in history after her fiasco. This extent marks not only the political death of Bibi, but of all involved.   
D. This isn't a popular point in this sub, but Israel really does value its citizens life. Gilad Shalit's exchange for over 1000 Palestinians is a good example of this.  
E. Israel has extensive programs to support families of anyone who has been hurt, killed or murdered at the hands of terror. The sheer number of casualties from the past three weeks are going to require a lot of financing, once all of this is over.   
3. Even if both points are untrue, why this specific escalation was not one that the Israeli government was interest in:  
A. The Israeli military was wholly unprepared for this - the bases were understaffed, equipment wasn't ready and the air force took 6 hours to respond. No one thought that this was going to happen.  
B. Multiple security staff took responsibility for this - from all military high ranking and relevant officers to the Shin Bet and everyone else. From  strategic perspective, once this whole thing is over, Israeli is going to lose a generation of security personnel due to their negligence. It's not just the 1400 victims - it's the loss of everyone who is going to take responsibility and leave.  
C. The military was just unprepared from the number of reserve recruits - people were drafted while equipment was missing and bases were unprepared.  
If the government was interested in this level of escalation, it would have saved faced by embracing the conflict well. But it was wholly unprepared.  
So what could be an explanation? [I think that this piece explains and outlines things well enough](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/yokra13636031) \- Google translate can help in understanding the details. Bottom line - October 7th will remain as a dark mark on Israel's leadership, sovereignty and and sense of security."

k6y2gvd,"Sir, that is some twisted logic you have. Let's look at what is really happening, but in your logic:

Your child is kidnapped, taken hostage to Gaza. IDF proceed to drop over 8000 bombs in a week to destroy Hamas (which are the ones who kidnapped). Wouldn't IDF in turn be killing your child, who is with Hamas? 

You seem to only care about one side of the conflict, suffering from confirmation bias."

I'm not Jewish or Israeli, but I'm a queer POC in the US and I'm trying to make sense of it all.

I found this Zoom video of a virtual forum moderated by Wider Bridge. It's informative (for me as an outsider). At one point, one person talks about how they also feel abandoned and betrayed by the people they've fought for.

FWIW, a person very close and important to me is Pro-Palestine (and I'm not). I asked them whether this would change our relationship but they said no. They know both of us support the same causes (pro-abortion, trans rights, gay rights, women's rights,  minority rights).

Israel‚Äôs response might even strengthen hamas: people could lose their friends and family during gaza bombings and get polarized to become hamas members themselves. If more people are converted to hamas than hamas soldiers are killed during this campaign, hamas will be just as strong if not stronger by the end of this war. 

I am not pro hamas but i am pro palestine. I understand that the only reason hamas behaves the way it does is because of the oppression against palestinians. hamas is a child of israel. they even helped hamas rise because they thought they could control them (google it it‚Äôs very interesting). 

This war will not help any country it will only kill thousands of thousands of innocent civilians and accomplish nothing."

Israel knows of far more than 7000 targets you know nothing about military intelligence and how it works clearly. 

why doesn't israel send in their SF teams into a huge city that's built like a fortress ? You clearly where not in the military or know absolutely nothing about thr military. or the gaza situation.

If you read The Origins of Palestinian Nationalism C3 after the young turk rebellion arab nationalism grew sharply, and they started to see Israelis as a threat. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution so even before they knew much about zionists, they saw they as a threat.

how much does this really matter when there are reams of footage and photographs of bodies littering the streets?

k6y1zi1,I just imagined a Hamas dude running through a tunnel with a 15 pound crt and yelling something all the way down it
k6y1z2c,"Stuff like this really makes it easy for the West to not really care much for them, and back Israel."
k6y1ytc,"No, she will get promoted. Folks chanting ""Free Palestine"" are at a greater risk  of having their academics and future jeopardized. This conflict and injustice transcend borders.

Edit: I witness this drama on my LinkedIn. The pro-zionist propaganda gets reposted, promoted and likes, loves, and celebrates from senior leadership in Fortune 100 companies. Lunatics posting it actually get noticed in a positive way and turn it into a professional self-promotion tool. On the other hand, the rare voices that point out neutral politically correct sources such as HRW and DWB pointing to the unprecedented humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza get no support from their leadership, mostly a few brave acquaintances. These same posters later in the week post resources about getting employment and anti-harassment lawyers and other resources."
k6y1ynf,"Once more, what is your alternative? In recent years, Israel tried to have less conflicts and not fight Hamas as much. There was even an increase in work Visas into Israel and money passed into Hamas hands. We wrongfully assumed that Hamas wanted to deal with the economic issues in Gaza.  


Then, they breached the walls, and murdered 1400 people, 1100 are civilians. Kidnapping over 200 others. Many of which are women and children.   


Again, I'm not happy for Palestinian death. It is a sad affair. But what do you suggest we do instead? Sacrificing our own soldiers doesn't come into account.   
If you want to offer an alternative, then the Palestinian people can resist Hamas, and overthrow it. Similarly to how Hamas threw the PLO off buildings in 2007. I promise you, if the Palestinians would fight Hamas and offer them to Israel, we would stop immediatly."
k6y1y2a,"They in Russia have quite distorted view of reality. They think that Israel is near collapse, the Jews are cowards and that no-one in the world allows the Jews in except Russia.

In private conversations with people in Russia and in social networks I hear the beliefs in stereotypes and gloat: they think the Jews are crowding the airports to flee from Israel and joke about which countries will allow them in. They also disbelieve that Jews can fight.

Additionally, it seems the current riots are likely to be inspired by the Russian government, which wants to draw attenttion from its defeat in Ukraine. They also want to fuel conflict between Muslim world and the USA.

Notice that the Russian police allowed the rioters to check the papers of the people in the hotel so to search for the Jews."
k6y1xwe,One could argue that Hamas didn't help any Palestinians strategically.
k6y1xsz,"I think they are going to level gaza. And thus, just plug all the tunnels. Then after at least week or maybe months go down and see what has happened. 

Clearing tunnels is dangerous and you don't do that if you don't have to. Israel can just wait and see what happens."
k6y1x8w,"By the way, there's no blockade, and even if there was on the Israeli side, you can certainly look at their friends in Egypt and ask them why aren't they doing anything for their Palestinian ""friends"". hat abuses the short-term memory people like you have. This time, they have gone way too far and no cease-fire will be given until Hamas is gone. 

By the way, there's no blockade, and even if there was on the Israeli side, you can certainly look at their friends in Egypt and ask them why aren't they doing anything for their Palestinian ""friends"". You do know they have another country bordering with them right?"
k6y1x93,"well, the sarcastic tone of the first  rhetorical question is not needed in this discussion if you wish to actually have a conversation and a meaningfull discussion.   
To the 2nd question I can answer, and the answer is yes - she saw people being born and die inside the ghetto.   
And she wasn't part of the Ghetto Warsaw uprising, but she was there when it happend.   


And beside that question, do you have any more questions that could benefit our discussion? or you just want to justify whatever hamas is doing in the name of 'freedom' ?"

Historically so many wars have happened, as well as peace treaties. Some times it takes a few years and there's peace between warring nations, other times it could take centuries but eventually humans get tired of hate and just make peace. However with this one, it's deeper than just land. I know many will be upset with me to say it, but It's so clearly more than just Palestine. Arab nations might have to do some soul searching on this issue. All parties tbh."

k6y1p3j,"In America we have half the country split but the right tends to be more extreme because of religion and many who are overtly racist probably do to less education and the fact that republican leaders like to pretend minorities have it better than white people. The left also does the same abs ignores poor people if they are white. But the right pretends Leftism is what the left mostly believes and it‚Äôs not. Most are progressives at most. Usually leftists are younger people in a phase. Kind of the same as the alt right but the alt right became much more legitimate because of Trump. 

But both sides are really run by corporations and special interests. The left by Pharma and Tech, the right by Pharma, weapons and oil. But the Zionist lobby has a real stranglehold on both sides although most Jewish Americans are on the left as liberals and aren‚Äôt even as crazy about Israel as Christians on the right. 

Also Jewish people can speak out more easily because you can‚Äôt call a Jewish person antisemitic with the same weight. So me being Palestinian American realize that people like Noam Chomsky are in a really good position to speak against Zionism without the baggage of being shut down and called racist against Jews. 

In England there has been a lot of push to make anti Israel or anti Zionism be equal to antisemitism to really stop all criticism of israel does. Has this happened in a lot of Europe. I always thought America had an unusual an stranglehold by the Zionist lobby but I guess Europe is the same in many ways. 

But to be fair from any point of view I think the Arabs in general really messed up and played right into the hands of Zionists by becoming more religious. Now there is a huge split and many Arabs became less religious and more educated but the far right religious groups like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt got elected. And those are the same people the Hamas originally came from who get funding from isrsel because they want more extremists to say they are justified in what they do to Palestinians and what they get Americans to vote for in their foreign policy. 

But when people are poor, uneducated because there is a more powerful group exploiting them it‚Äôs hard not to go to religion more because it‚Äôs all you have left sometimes. But Palestinians have actually had a good education system, mostly because it‚Äôs the one good thing the British did when they controlled it, so I don‚Äôt get why they cling to it as hard. At least in Gaza it‚Äôs more understandable but the West Bank has to focus on education to get out of this mess and use it to create wealth and influence before Isrsel takes all of the land that‚Äôs left. 
Gaza on the other hand is really tough because it‚Äôs literally a prison and without Hamas they would‚Äôve probably stole half of their land like the West Bank but Hamas is also the excuse israel uses to do what they do. So I feel horrible for the people because they are screwed either way and Hamas is now underground in their tunnels while isrsel bombs the civilians on top.

What good is that America is send special forces to help isrsel. I hope this backfires because many Americans are wondering why we are sending our own people and billions to die for this fascist country. I hope people wake up to this. 

Ultimately politics in America is about how to move tax money to the people that help you win your elections with their donations. So America says we need to help Ukraine abs they take billions of our tax money to buy weapons from Americans manufacturers and give them to Ukraine. Now these weapons guys get super wealthy and in turn they bankroll the next election for the ones who supported this. America knows our people are sick of wars so instead they are trying to proxy wars indirectly now."

The number of Christians in Gaza is already small, it's unfortunately not unlikely that the last remaining communities will be wiped out completely if the war doesn't stop soon. I think it's also ironic how the West is rather obvious in their disdain for Palestinian (and Arab) Muslims and are vocal about it as well but Palestinian Christians don't even make it in the news for neither good or bad. It's as if they literally didn't exist to the outside world, yet they are the oldest Christian community in the world and the place where it all began."

It's their choice, and it's a valid choice. No need to resort to dehumanizing them or building this fantastic idea that they're out to kill Jews, etc., to understand it.

k6y1dc5,"&gt; You say no one has an alternative, what's the current plan even? 

The current immediate plan would be to weaken Hamas. 

Israel isn't stupid enough to think that Hamas can be completely eradicated by any military action - but that doesn't make a military action pointless.

The attacks on October 7th showed that Hamas had far more military capability and were a far larger threat than Israel ever thought. Israel simply cannot let that threat remain. 

Hamas *existing* is a secondary problem.

Hamas having the capabilities to invade and kill more than a thousand civilians and being an real threat is a primary problem, that needs to be addressed *right now*. Israel simply cannot afford to let Hamas continue being a threat on that level. 

Hence the current military action. 

Yes, you won't be able to bomb Hamas out of existence - but every bombed Hamas weapon cache mean less weapons Hamas can aim at Israeli civilians *right now*. Every Hamas soldier killed mean one less animal prepared to go into a Israeli town to rape and butcher civilians *right this moment*. Every Hamas tunnel bombed makes it harder for Hamas to operate *right now*... and so on.

Hamas might get more weapons from Iran in the future, might regrow their numbers, and might rebuild their tunnels and bunkers - but that's things that's years down the line. Those are long term problems that Israel will have to try finding a solution for eventually - but right now they have an immediate threat that has to be dealt with, right now."

and, ‚ÄúIn the aftermath of war, the U.N. humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records.

In all cases the U.N.'s counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza Health Ministry‚Äôs, with small discrepancies.

‚Äî 2008 war: The ministry reported 1,440 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 1,385.

‚Äî 2014 war: The ministry reported 2,310 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 2,251.

‚Äî 2021 war: The ministry reported 260 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 256.

While Israel and the Palestinians disagree over the numbers of militants versus civilians killed in past wars, Israel‚Äôs accounts of Palestinian casualties have come close to the Gaza ministry‚Äôs. For instance, Israel‚Äôs Foreign Ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians ‚Äî just a bit lower than the ministry‚Äôs toll.‚Äù

 - another witness (woman) said on Israeli TV, that Hamas came to her house where she and two of her children were - they immediately told her not to worry and and to sit with her children. She said that they were looking around the house for weapons (her guess). when they did not find any they left - on the way out one of them asked her if he can take a banana from her table and she said ""yes""

 - so they were not there to kill civilians - most of the civilians died in shootout between Israeli soldiers and Hamas - or some civilians who were carrying weapons were killed because they were presenting danger (only settlers of kibbutzim are allowed to have weapons in Israel and most of them do)

k6y02pr,"There was at least one attempt to ambush from tunnel in Northern Gaza. Reportedly ""tens militants killed"". My guess is they are waiting for IDF to advance into urban areas proper. Attacking in the open is very high risk of being picked up by air support."
k6y0246,"What would you do? Peace with those who cut off children's feet before burning them alive to the cry of ""Yahud""? I want peace and I want the civilians of Gaza (and Israel) to stop dying. But what would YOU do?"
k6y01l9,Most of Hamas are inside tunnels/buildings in the cities. Israeli infantry and armor has only been spotted near the outskirts of towns
k6y01gt,"Not trying to murder them all, especially not without an actual plan. 

This ""what would you do"" stuff is insane. How can any of it can be an appropriate response in the eyes of anyone?."
k6y01do,Cant we just say kill Hamas and call it a day?
k6y0184,"You have the numbers twisted, and clearly you think Israel loveeeeees war so much that they want to go into a war zone. Think about it, Israel wants to protect their citizens and soldiers from booby traps and violence first hand. Your claim is that rocket attacks are what? Cowardice? Tell that to hamas"
k6y017y,"And look at him. People have all but forgotten about the corruption charges, [they are moving to remove power from the supreme court.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-65086871) All the while he gets to point at an enemy and play the warlord, [for which enemy he himself funded](https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/netanyahu-money-to-hamas-part-of-strategy-to-keep-palestinians-divided-583082) It's like a messed up version of bread and circus to keep the brutal cycle going."

Come here to escape all that bullshit"
k6xzzhq,"I wonder how much will they commit to the invasion? Seems to have been a significant reduction in the scope of the incursion. What is Israel‚Äôs plan for after? They level the North of Gaza and then what? 
Hamas will just return in some other form if the Palestinians have no way to build a future."
k6xzyib,"&gt;North Korea doing things

incursions, not hundreds of North Koreans paragliding into South Korea and carrying out a massacre of over a thousand people."
k6xzycl,"you see you are exactly what I'm talking about. You have lost touch with reality.

I don't know what headlines you have read but I have seen ""at least 40 bodies of babies, some of them were beheaded"". It doesn't mean that we claimed that 40 beheaded babies were found. But regardless it doesn't cancel out that atrocity in the first place. If you had any morality it wouldn't matter to you too.

News flash - Hamas uses platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram to spread their propaganda because they aren't being fact-checked like mainstream media. And look at you, believing the word of a terrorist organization over people with actual human decency. Says a lot about what kind of person you are."
k6xzy8k,If it was about living freely as palestinians they wouldnt have refused the peace offers
k6xzwr4,"‚ÄúSignatures?‚Äù I assure you, the reason they do it is to not reveal their capabilities which, once known, can then be exploited."
k6xzwoc,Howdy Arabia
k6xzuwe,"Lol - Israel is self sufficient militarily. The us support is nice but at this point we‚Äôre strong enough to take on the fight ourselves and obliterate everyone if we want to. Even if the west doesn‚Äôt support it, so what are they gonna do? Write biased news article? Go protest in their streets? We don‚Äôt give a fuck. When their civilians are slaughtered at the scale of October 7 we‚Äôll see how they react."
k6xzu35,"The thing is, leaving the West Bank is a major security benefit, maybe except the large settlements that could be swapped with some Arab cities as part of land swaps that would hopefully occur in the future.

The IDF, having to defend every nut job placing a tent on some hill somewhere with entire regiments is a major security blunder, and it was one of the reasons the IDF wasn't prepared to act on the Oct. 7th massacre"
k6xzu13,"You didn't WANT to know.

I'm grew up in a rural area, and since 2008 I've seen rural people go from being ""us"" to ""them"", being dehumanized as a bunch of racists, homophobes, being called transphobes, and all the rest, just because the urban left in the U.S. needs boogeymen to make their persecution dreams real.  It's been like watching the religious right in the 1980's when they were searching every graveyard for a Satanist to support their ""Satanic panic"", except it's been the left searching every West Virginia backwoods for a racist.

How do you think we feel having been public enemy #1 for the past 20 years ?  You didn't really think that half of the country living outside the cities were all just a bunch of racists did you ?

Or did you ?

Hey, I get it, I didn't know that the tolerance class was going to hate me either, until they did.

Peaceful and progressive, .. really ?!?  You didn't notice BLM literally burning buildings and tearing down public monuments, and assaulting people who disagreed with them ?

Dude, all they are doing now is exactly what they did when you were ""with them"", except now they're doing it to YOU.

Like I said, welcome to party.  Now you get to know what it's like to be the designated asshole for a while.  Now you get to be the one they malign with all the words."
k6xztbi,That implies a false equivalence. There is no equivalence between the IDF and hamas. There is no equivalence between fighting a war solely to exterminate a people and losing then claiming victim status while terrorizing civilians. Israel has done shady shit but it is nothing compared to what groups like hamas are capable of
k6xzso2,You are crazy if you think Mandela would support Hamas after he witnesses acts of terrorism by Hamas. Killing innocent people is never justified. Deaths of innocent people is justified in no war. It only means that people who kill innocent people have lost humanity. What just cause will you fight for when your humanity is dead ?
k6xzse6,"&gt;Same as the us isn't worried about China invading the US homeland

the US isn't worried about that because China is incapable of invading the US mainland, China however experienced a hundred years of foreign invasions only ending after WW2(arguably even as late as 1999 with the return of Hong Kong), they are understandably paranoid about allowing the USA to have influence in a neighbouring state."
k6xzsd0,Well considering how intertwined UNWA and Hamas are in Gaze some of them could have been legitimate targets.
k6xzrmi,"Antizionism is antisemitism, 
Yes they treated jews well in their countries BUT jews living independently without paying dhimmi taxes is against their religion, fundamentalist muslims believe jews rebelled against their god by establishing a jewish government so they seek to take the land back and kill all the jews"
k6xzra0,I‚Äôm convinced Russia at the bare minimum encouraged Hamas to attack how they did so that the world‚Äôs attention would be taken off of Ukraine.
k6xzqfb,"Netanyahu signed on it, but directing the anger only towards him is very selective.    
There was a huge campaign pushing for it in the public and in the media. From ads whereever you look to news organization to celebrities (staying in a dungeon for an hour each is remebered especially) to the higher-ups in Israel security saying Israel can contain the potential damage of releasing the terrorists.     (https://www.makorrishon.co.il/opinion/681067/), etc.    
Netanyahu might went for it cynically to gain public credit, but that tells you where a lot of the public was on this topic. I was one of the people that bought into the campaign as well."
k6xzq7u,I don't think they want but they have to.
k6xzpsk,"It's not a bad suggestion, but I see two problems...

1. It's expensive long term to maintain an ever-increasing array of defensive layers, in terms of finances, manpower, resources, and political will.
2. The people on the other side will eventually find a weakness.

Ultimately, I think there's no way around the issue. At some point, they need to eliminate the cancer that is corrupting Gazan society, and right now its name is Hamas."
k6xzoxv,Lmao
k6xzos7,"Hey man this is the guy I listen too, he looks at both sides of the story without bullshit politics in between hope this helps: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro-ERnn7-uo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro-ERnn7-uo), this guy isn't on either side has no biases.

k6xznw6,"I was in a cult with my grandparents when I was young. It was an offshoot of Seventh Day Adventists.

Both groups call actual Jews everything from lizard people to subhumans."
k6xzfyf,Yet people around the world demand ceasefire from Israel. Haven‚Äôt heard anything about anyone demand Hamas to ceasefire.  So basically asking Israel to stop fighting back and take whatever beating Hamas gave. You might as well ask Israel to kill themselves
k6xzfhm,"Buddy, if people's faiths were measured by group solidarity, no one would be religious anymore to begin with. Middle Eastern Christians have always felt separate from Western Christians because of this shit to begin with.

k6xzexc,"I was in Southern Israel at a couple of different Kibbutz this year. They all use Thai people to do the agricultural work. Pretty odd set up that was really surprising for me at least. Kind of surprised that Hamas took them hostage, as Israelis give very few fucks about them."
k6xzeyo,Do you want White people to die for Israel?
k6xzey4,how does that even remotely justify shooting up UN personnel? not like Israel has the right to kick the UN out.
k6xzepy,"I‚Äôm very left wing and I want no ceasefire. We need to take out Hamas, for ourselves, for the Palestinians, for the Iranians, and for every peace loving human in the world.

And then we can forcefully remove the right wing Israelis nutjobs who are fucking around in the West Bank and putting everyone at risk for a temper tantrum. It‚Äôs completely unacceptable. They should have been forcefully removed by the Israeli government a long time ago."

North Korea isn't going to just randomly do some civilian massacres in South Korea."
k6xzapf,"Yes, exactly that, placing checkpoints. There are also reports of hamas shooting at fleeing civilians who refuse to go back north."
k6xz9vf,"I feel at this point there must be a non-trivial number of Palestinian citizens who have a voice in the back of their head asking if, in retrospect, electing a party dedicated to the elimination of Israel might have contributed to this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Any Palestinian and Gazan who has no problem with the Israeli people must be mentally ill.

In the early 1940's you could have said that about Japan and the USA, both directions. And yet now they are allies with strong political and trade relationships, whose young people deeply admire each other's cultures.

Get rid of the old, stupid people waging the wars and it will sort itself out."
k6xz8zu,It was always a lie. You think Israel is a democracy? They spent years strangling what little of a left wing they had and now here's the inevitable result. There is a reason they had some of their largest protests in history all summer right before Oct. 7th.

Why don't the Israelis send in their swat team or special forces like the Americans would do? They have a legit army. The U.S. tay payer pays 3.8 billion every year to Israel for their military. We also pay for their free healthcare which we don't get but that's another topic.

To make this conflict about Islam is disgusting; it's an attempt to weasel out of responsibility for the brutality that's been inflicted and the genocide that's being carried out. There are plenty of Christian Palestinians who feel the same way about Israel as the Muslim Palestinians. They're right to. Their land was stolen from them! 
I understand Israelis are annoyed and shocked that the local Arab population can't get over it, but it's their right not to get over it. That does not mean they're out to get Jews. Hating someone for what they're *doing* is NOT the same as hating someone for their ethnic background."

k6xydxx,"Un workers would never interfere. Also there's un buildings in gaza. Hamas fires rockets from right next to these buildings on purpose.

This is speculation. It hasn't actually happened, even by the current far right coalition.

Huh? No, I'm saying they're hated because most people in Israel don't like violence. Where did I imply it was a PR issue?
&gt;Not becausr colonizining land is fundamentaly wrong
You do understand that there were ancient Jewish communities in the west bank, like in east Jerusalem and Hebron that were ethnically cleansed during the Nakba, right? Imagine telling a Jew who can trace their roots countless generations in Jerusalem that they're ""colonizing"" it.
Regardless, why can't two indigenous communities live in a country called Palestine, together? They're able to live in Israel proper no problem."
k6xybsy,"""Contrary to what the Israeli government claims, Israel‚Äôs withdrawal of its ground forces from Gaza in 2005 did not end its occupation of Gaza.
That is because, ever since, Israel has maintained effective control over Gaza, including its territorial waters and airspace, the movement of people and goods, except at Gaza‚Äôs¬†border with Egypt, and the infrastructure upon which Gaza relies, rendering the Strip an¬†open-air prison.¬†
Under IHL, Israel is required, as the occupying power, to make sure that the basic needs of the population of Gaza, such as food and water, are met."""
k6xybph,"Displaced by who? 
The richest of the Palestinians left when they sold their land to rich Jews. These people were welcomed into other Arab countries.
Most others started leaving when the Arab High Council ordered them to leave. Then they used these people to do the invasion.
Many others left because they were in a war zone started by the Arabs.
How many soldiers were assigned to displacing hundreds of thousands of people? You do realize that this takes a large organization to do so. The Jews were too busy defending themselves and their country for this supposed task force that has no evidence of ever existing.
There were bands of both Jewish and Arab soldiers that terrorized each others smaller villages. Most Jews were fighting a three front war against 10x their numbers.  
Cities like Haifa which had 65000 people in 1947 was found deserted by the Israelis in 1948. There were multiple journalists who documented this in 1948.

The whole idea that Israel dictates what Gaza receives in terms of resources and who can move freely out of it is a system of occupation. Palestinians should be given their freedom from this ruling occupation and they should have the right to self determination."

cant they understand that ""free Palestine"" actually means unrestrained slaughter of Israelis? 
cant they understand that ""free Palestine"" is giving power to Hammas and/or similar organizations?
""Free Palestine"" - that same Palestine that throws gays from rooftops, same Palestine that teaches children to be martyrs, same Palestine that is funded indirectly by Russia, same Russia that oppresses free press and kidnaps children from Ukraine.
""but they are not in a vacuum, Israel literally opresses them and puts them in the largest jail in the world' - YEAH THIS iS WHY ISRAEL IS DOING THAT! it wasn't a jail 15 years ago and people were free to go anywhere in or from Gaza.
Same Palestine that given the slightest of opportunities slaughters and rapes children in their homes, YES there were not only hammas terrorists that went thorough that hole in the fence on OCT 7. There was that one literally calling his mother ""mummy mummy be proud I just killed 10 jews"". FREE PALESTINE!"

k6xy7q1,"The article discusses recent developments in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The key points mentioned are:

1. Senior Hamas political leadership member Ali Barakeh stated that they did not anticipate a significant response from the US after Hamas attacked Israel.

2. The US provided considerable support to Israel during its conflict with Hamas, which took Hamas by surprise.

3. The US sent a carrier strike group, featuring the USS Gerald R. Ford, closer to Israel and considered sending additional military assets, such as a second aircraft carrier and fighter jets.

4. Later, the US sent Lt.-Gen. James Glynn, a three-star US Marines general, and other military officers to assist Israel in planning its ground offensive into Gaza.

5. Iran, which supports Hamas, has noticed the increased US support for Israel and has issued threats in response.

6. US forces in the region have recently been targeted by Iran-backed militia.


theories and reasons why Hamas might not have anticipated such a significant response from the US:

1. **Historical US Stance**: Historically, while the US has been a staunch ally of Israel, it has not always directly intervened militarily in Israel's conflicts with Hamas. Thus, Hamas might have assumed that the US would maintain its traditional diplomatic and financial support role without direct military involvement.


2. **Domestic Politics**: Hamas might have believed that the current US administration would be more hesitant to involve itself directly due to potential domestic political repercussions. Every administration's approach to the Israel-Palestine issue can vary based on its political inclinations, the national mood, and its foreign policy goals.


3. **Shift in Global Power Dynamics**: The global political landscape has been evolving, with powers like China and Russia asserting themselves more. Hamas might have anticipated that the US would be more preoccupied with these larger geopolitical issues and less likely to focus on the Israel-Hamas conflict.


4. **Miscalculation**: It's entirely possible that Hamas simply miscalculated the extent to which the US would go in supporting Israel this time around. Military and political strategies often involve a series of predictions and assumptions, and not all of them turn out to be accurate.


5. **Symbolic Attacks**: Hamas might have believed that their attacks would be seen more as symbolic resistance rather than a direct challenge warranting significant international intervention.


6. **Deterrence Strategy**: From Hamas's perspective, launching attacks might be a strategy to galvanize their base, assert their dominance in Palestinian politics against rivals like Fatah, and draw international attention to their cause. They might not have anticipated that this would lead to such a strong US response.


7. **Diplomatic Channels**: Hamas might have received indications, through back channels or other diplomatic means, that led them to believe the US response would be more muted."
