k70v9yk,"I didn't deny anything you said.

I said Israel doesn't use human shields and Gaza does. Which is a fact.

You chose to change the subject to Israel having locals in Gaza deliver messages for them years ago. The behavior you're complaining about ceased.

So what was the point of bringing it up when I said Israel doesn't use human shields and Gaza does? Just as a distraction?",1
k70v865,"&gt;Yes, exactly, Hamas attacked, not the 1 million kids in Gaza. No amount of capslock or invoking of October 7th is gonna make murdering kids ok

Which makes all of that Hamas's fault.  EVERY death since October 7th, by bullet, bomb, every single kid who dies, is Hamas's fault.

That's why in the United States if you're part of a 3 person bank robbery, every person who dies is a murder that is on your hands.  Even the 2 other people who are with you, if they get shot by a security guard, that's a murder charge for you, because you're the one responsible for everything that happened as a result of you taking a gun into a bank to commit a robbery.

The safety of every child in Gaza was Hama's responsibility, and they willingly put all of those lives in jeopardy when they attacked Israel.  So spare us all the equivocation and acting like all of this is suddenly some evil that the Israeli's are perpetrating on the innocents of Gaza ... Hamas could stop all of this at any moment if they wanted to, all they'd have to do is lay down their weapons, release their hostages, and surrender to be judged for their crimes on October 7th.

Honestly, getting into the weeds of the specific conditions in all the agreements and finding excuses to declare them ""unfair"" to the Palestinians is a bit like people arguing over whether 40 babies were actually beheaded by Hamas or if it was just 20 or if they just had their throats slit.

k70u7fd,"The question should be *“How should the Arab People Respond to the Response of their Governments”*

The government can’t do shit without a population of people who let them. 

Arab people have the inherent right as human beings to tell their government what to do, and if they don’t, to yeet them out of power. 

Although it is a running joke that American individuals own too many advanced weapons that they we sometimes use on each other, the but *reason* we actually have those is because we know and truly believe in our souls that we have every goddamn right to **overthrow our government. 


Step 1. Stop utilizing death and maiming as a first response to conflict. Y’all have too many very young people that are exploited over and over by a very teeny tiny number of very old very rich people that have consolidated and the control of all the wealth. Death should NOT be the immediate consequence for bad behavior or conflict. 

Step 2. Arab people should force your governments to unite under a banner of “Arab Unity” and put aside internal and external religious conflicts. Again, you have too many young people. Stop allowing young adults to fight. Children should never fight anyway, neither should any Arab from the ages 18-45 right now. If a fight needs to be had, the filthy rich old people who have all the money who use young adult to fight on their behalf should use themselves as fighters and then when they’re dead, the 18-45 year olds and the rest of the older non filthy rich should take that money and use it for Step 3-5. 

Step 3. Empower civilians through providing an advanced secular universal educational curriculum for all girls and boys that focuses on STEM. 

Step 4. Create an environment of creativity and fund those now educated young men and women to create valuable industries that produce products and services that can both raise the Arab people up economically but also a resource that no one else has to export or trade for valuable imports. *My suggestion* is ANTI-AGING AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY as The West has a whole bunch of old people with a lot of money to spend on not being old, and Arab nations have a whole bunch of young people who have a lot time left on the clock to think of how use that as their advantage. 

Step 5. When one nation is dependent on another for valuable imports that nation becomes a ✨valuable ally✨, and just like magic, that new alliance and their thoughts and concerns suddenly become very important and their best interests become better protected and enforced. 

Play the long game. Not the short.

k70tjd1,"These kinds of posts annoy me because they make the assumption that Hamas carried out this attack in some weird way to restart the peace process or extract concessions…. Or something. I don’t see why people would think that Hamas, a group that has always called for the destruction of Israel and the death of Jews, would be interested in any peace talks. We know who they are because they tell us, they purposefully crafted the situation they’re in right now. You can criticize Israel, and there are legitimate reasons to, but leaving out Hamas is naive and ignorant. Hamas teaches that civilians who die killed by Israel are martyrs, its leaders have doubled down saying that it’s better for them to die in Gaza than live a miserable life, and that Palestinians are willing to “pay the ultimate price” for their “freedom”. This is a group that, when Israel was negotiating a peace deal, launched suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians to try to derail the peace talks. This is a group that, when Israel left Gaza and pulled out its settlers, attacked its fellow Palestinians in control of Gaza and took over, then began firing rockets at Israel prompting an Israeli-Egyptian blockade. They were never interested in peace. 

What they can do is just surrender and save the lives of thousands of Gazans, as well as allow aid to resume. Their continued “resistance” is NOT going to result in an independent Palestinian state, it’s only going to result in more dead Palestinians and an Israeli occupation. They don’t care, like they’ve said, Gazan deaths are for the cause so they’re acceptable.",0

These discussions are only difficult to reinforce with facts, if you choose not to look for them. I try not to form arguments without supporting facts, and to be frank, am not convinced by arguments actively avoiding them. 

All Palestinians didn't participate in a terrorism of 7 October, nor are they doing ""Jihad"". That would literally be impossible. You realise [Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad#:~:text=Jihad%20(%2Fd%CA%92%C9%AA%CB%88h,especially%20with%20a%20praiseworthy%20aim.) is a word approximating ""struggling"" or ""striving""? It's a very broad term that can range from the benign such as a devout Muslim person making an effort to do their regular praying, to the radical such as when Osama bin-Laden called for Jihad against the United States. (Again, please note that al-Qaeda and bin-Laden don't represent Muslims.)

Again, you are making the astounding error of impugning the entire people of Palestine, over vague personal anecdotes. I'm sure there were sick people in every country, who relished the 9/11 NYC attacks. (I'll remind you again that the majority of Palestinians in Gaza aren't even old enough to remember 9/11 or George Bush) There was also a lot of people who showed their support and sympathy to Americans with vigils -- including places like America's current-archenemy *Iran*. Does that cherry-picked example mean Iran is really best friends of USA? Of course not!

I've also seen videos of Americans marching in the streets with sw*astika flags and chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". Does this mean all Americans want a genocide of Jews and hate Israel? Not according to any reliable polling. Not according to the US government giving the all-time highest amount of cumulative aid to Israel.  

I've personally seen videos of hardline Israelis calling for genocide against Palestinians. Does that represent all Israelis? Does that delegitimize the right of the State of Israel to exist? I think you get the point by now.

A large number of refugees also lived in the West Bank, or as it was called then, Transjordan, which was under the jurisdiction of Jordan, and in Gaza, which was de facto part of Egypt until the six day war. From 1949 until now, even when directly under the governments of Jordan and Egypt, These Palestinians were never granted citizenship, largely because they have instead been used as a bargaining chip by the Arab League to garner international sympathy for the refugee crisis. 

Israel will not allow them to return to where their ancestors were displaced, because now their population has multiplied several times over and if granted citizenship in Israel, have given all indications that Israel would cease to exist and the Jews would be expelled and massacred.

But I think there's an unspoken assumption/acknowledgment in your post that actually they would still be looking to destroy Israel. I hope that's not true, but again, multiple failed attempts at peace and refusal to recognise Israel don't make me very optimistic.

k70s5aa,"&gt;The current Israeli government doesn't. They've offered multiple two-state deals that were flatly rejected.

This just isn't a factual statement.

The first crucial steps in normalizing diplomacy between the PA and Israel were undertaken by Fatah and the Israeli Labor Party in 1993 - but they were put on hold after Netanyahu won office following the assassination of  Rabin in '95. Coincidentally, some of Netanyahu's campaign stunts included posters with images of Rabin in a set of crosshairs, and a mock funeral procession where pallbearers shouted ""Death to Rabin!"" while parading around a casket with Rabin's image posted onto it. Netanyahu was even made aware by Israel's security chief that there was a plot to kill Rabin, and was asked to please tone it down. *He refused.*

Fortunately, he wasn't in office very long the first time around, and negotiations were reopened under Ehud Barak.

The 2000 Camp David summit saw both sides being willing to make major compromises, but not enough to bridge the gap. There's plenty of blame to be placed on both Israel and the PA for the failure of the Camp David summit, though it's telling that Barak's Foreign Minister (who was present for the accord) stated that ""if I were Palestinian, I would also have rejected Camp David.""

But that wasn't the end of the peace process. They continued to meet and negotiate, with both sides proving willing to make even more concessions on what had been previously un-negotiable maximum demands, and by 2001 at Taba were *just about* to sign a viable, mutually agreeable two-state treaty.

But then Ehud Barak's term ran out, and the Likud party swept into office once more - and, once more, scrapped the plans and shut down negotiations.

The PA has, since '93, been extremely interested in finally coming to a negotiated settlement - much to its own detriment, as Palestinians become increasingly frustrated by the Israeli Right refusing to meet this diplomatic tack in good faith. They've not had a partner willing and able to meet with them for good faith negotiations in the Israeli gov't since 2001, though - and the Likud policy of seeking to consistently delegitimize and destabilize the PA is a major part of why we've arrived at the crisis we currently find ourselves in.",0

* The Armistice agreement of 1949 left a large amount of land in the possession of the Arabs, but instead of forming an independent Palestine, they decided to set up refugee camps/organizations and keep the Palestinians stateless.
* In 1967, the Arab nations attacked again, and lost a significant amount of land. Israel gave back most of the land, but the Arabs still did not establish a state of Palestine.
* In 2000, in the Camp David talks, the Palestinians were given a new two-state proposal which they again rejected. They then launched the Second Intifada, fairly similar to what's happening now.

k70r8g0,"1. Heavily depopulated is a Zionist myth. It comes from the phrase “a land without a people for a people without a land” there were arabs living in this region of Palestine which had been an Islamic country for over 1300 years before the British. A simple look into the ottoman registry called the Nufus. The “underpopulated” myth is blown up by the discussions of early Zionists, such as Chaim Weizmann, who when asked about the inhabitants of Palestine responded with: “The British told us that there are there some hundred thousands negroes [Kushim] and for those there is no value.”.

2) the Jews weren’t promised “tiny bit of silver from a big land”. The belfour declaration showed intention to make Palestine one big Jewish state. Also why did you conveniently leave out the two state solution would be giving land not owned by the Jews to the Jews, including the best and most fertile land in the region along with most of the ports. It was a ripoff from day one and arabs were in their right to decline it

3) “the Palestinian identity was there wayyyyy before 1967. You’re using typical colonial arguments used against indigenous people in order to minimize their claim to the land. Take for example national identities such as “Italian” or “German”. These national identities are very recent, barely coming into existence at the end of the 1800s. Yet, nobody claims that Germans or Italians are a “fake” people, despite their national identity not existing 200 years ago. Throughout history, peoples have often changed how they identified politically. The Sardinians eventually became Italians, Prussians became Germans. That doesn’t give you the right to say Palestine and palestinians didn’t exist so land theft is acceptable…

4. “Yes they owned some of it but they didn’t govern it” because the Zionist British refused to give the indigenous Palestinians their own government. They helped overthrew the ottomans (which u fail to mention) in promise of their own recognized nation- just for British to refuse them government and bring in Jews in hopes of making Balfour declaration come true. Just because they weren’t allowed to have a government after the ottomans left doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be in power.

5. The British were not ran out by arabs. Yes arabs were fighting zionists but in 1947 the zionists were fighting both arabs AND the British. 

6. To be clear, UNGA resolution 181 simply did NOT partition Palestine. It was only a partition plan, which was to be seen as a recommendation, and that the issue should be transferred to the Security Council. Israel was unilaterally declared by Zionist leadership in may 1948 by force while the Security Council was still trying to arrive at a conclusion. The plan was never implemented. And even if it was, there is nothing in the UN charter that confers such authority to the United Nations. So this means israel was created through conquest, which has been illegal since 1945. 

7. “They agreed to share the land while colonial arabs disagreed” COLONIAL NATIVES YOU SAY?? It is unanimously agreed upon that the Jews are settlers and that Palestinian arabs are the natives of the land. This is how the British, the UN among others legally define these terms. Also- if arabs are the “colonialists” (who’ve been the majority of the land for milleniums)- how many immigrated there??? How many Jews were in Palestine before the mandate??? Less than 50% of the population, the VAST majority of whom just immigrated, wanted half the land. the arabs have a legal right to refuse this. 

8. Not every country disobeys international law even tho international organizations favour Israeli interests over the internet’s of the native Palestinians. Not every country conquers another after conquest becomes illegal. Not every country was founded on genocide and ethnic cleansing",1

A quote from the article:

""At the same time, Egypt says a mass exodus from Gaza would bring Hamas or other Palestinian militants onto its soil. That might be destabilizing in Sinai, where Egypt’s military fought for years against Islamic militants and at one point accused Hamas of backing them.

Egypt has backed Israel’s blockade of Gaza since Hamas took over in the territory in 2007, tightly controlling the entry of materials and the passage of civilians back and forth. It also destroyed the network of tunnels under the border that Hamas and other Palestinians used to smuggle goods into Gaza.

1. First off, WW2 predates Geneva Conventions and was extremely brutal for civilian populations. The French Resistance knew this and still tried to separate themselves from civilians as much as possible when they carried out their attacks. Still, it would not have been a war crime under the GC for Germany to cause collateral damage attacking the French Resistance. Using human shields and hiding among civilians is a war crime. Collateral damage among those civilians isn't.

2. If Hamas fires laser guided bombs, they can easily attack that building and only that building. That is what Israel does. Unfortunately for Palestine, Hamas hides their war assets in civilian buildings like hospitals (proof above) because they want as many civilians dead as possible because that's bad for Israel 

These tactics are very clear. It's crazy how so many people think you can rape and murder whoever you want as long as you hold your own baby up in front of you after.

Point taken. However, drawing direct parallels between these histories and the Israeli-Palestinian situation oversimplifies the unique circumstances and timelines of each.

While we can acknowledge historical wrongs globally, it's crucial to approach each situation in its context. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is relatively recent, with many of the displaced people still alive today. The immediacy of the pain and ongoing nature of the conflict makes it different from cases where the colonized or displaced populations were integrated, marginalized, or eradicated centuries ago.

Acknowledging the historical context of other countries shouldn't preclude us from striving for justice and peaceful coexistence in the present-day Israeli-Palestinian context. The goal should be to learn from history and seek solutions that prioritize human rights and mutual respect.",1

The Palestinian flag is the pan arabist  of the bhattist party .  Arabs. Didn't identify as palastinians until 1964 , they identified as Arabs or either Egyptians  , syrians , or jordenians to be more specific . 


&gt;and naturally a Palestinian state would have been established after the end of the British colonization

Accept Arabs refused a palastinian state in 1948 in favor of building a pan arabist state including Jewish owned land in Israel and they kept refusing for indipendece until 1988

&gt;Palestinians didn’t get that right bcs another occupation happened soon after

There wasn't another occupation

 there was a un offer to give the land both to Jews and Arabs . The Jews accepted and Arabs started a genocidal war and lost . The west bank was ruled by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt who lost it in 1967 to Israel

The only area of the world then with high Jewish populations at the time in which large proportions of the non-Jewish populations were NOT “anti-Semitic” as in “anti-Jewish” (\*) was the Arab world. In the only Muslim country occupied by the Germans (Tunisia) Muslims concealed their Jewish compatriots from the Nazis (hence why the Germans could not capture most). Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo had huge Jewish populations since centuries … who only spoke Arabic…. and felt totally integrated (in Iraq there had been Jewish members of the cabinet). Furthermore, many Jewish refugees went to Palestine, and got accepted. In fact after 1947 it took false flag operations(blaming your action on someone else), Moroccan Jews did not want to leave Morocco; they were “Helped” by provocations which were largely fabricated outside Morocco (guess by who?). Iraqi Jews were coerced by Israel during the Baghdad bombings  


 The baghdad bombings for those of you who don't know:  
 (1950-1951) was a series of False-flag bombings on Jewish targets in Baghdad with the intention to encourage Iraqi Jews to immigrate to Israel. According to Moshe Gat, Meir-Glitzenstein, Samuel Klausner, Rayyan Al-Shawaf and Yehouda Shenhav, there is wide consensus among Iraqi Jews that the Zionists were behind the bombings. This belief was shared among Historian Abbas Shiblak, Iraqi Jew Naeim Giladi, CIA agent Wilbur Crane and the British Embassy of Baghdad. When the 'Lavon Affair False-flag operations (1954)' broke out, Shalom Cohen (Knesset Israeli Politician at a later stage) remarked, ""This method of operating was not invented for Egypt. It was tried before in Iraq."" In a 2006 publication, Yehuda Tager, an Israeli agent who operated in Baghdad, confirmed Zionist involvements in the bombings.

I would also like to point out that it was the Muslims/Arabs who returned the Jews to Jerusalem in the first place after Khalid ibn al walid(RA) and Omar al Khattab(RA) took it over from the Chrisitans, [Roy Cassandra talks through it well in this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5cL11dps4Y).  


Your notion that the Jews did not have it well before 1948 in the Arab world is wrong, before 1948 Jews, Christians and Muslims all lived together in peace. Muslims even held the keys to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and open its doors every morning and close them every night, it has been described as a ""great honour"" by the 2 families who hold the keys.

and to answer your questions:  
 \- How can people hold onto faith, when it compels to hate:  
this is not true, I can not speak for Christianity or Judaism but in Islam One nnocent live has  
the value of the whole of hummanity "" That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel   
that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it   
will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all

k70prt4,"I would like to disagree with the argument that because Israel was supported by rich white powerful people, that it thereby somehow makes it a colonial settlement. Which, will you haven't used the word colonialism yourself, could perhaps be inferree. Nonetheless, it is clear that the Zionist movement required money and global support but that shouldn't make it any less of a ""viable"" settlement in and of itself.

I do agree however, that the British were more sympathetic towards the Jews than towards the Arabs (evident perhaps as an example by the Balfour declaration as opposed to the houssein-mcmahon correspondences). The Brits did sort of try to take a U-turn in the late 1930s but it was clear that they wanted nothing more to do with the region. 

The Palestinians were treated unjustly. There are many reasons that I can expand on if you wish. In part because they didn't understand the importance (ultimately, out of understandingly no need) of forming a national movement for a long time. Perhaps in part because the Zionist movement was created by Europeans whom the Brits found it ""easier"" to trust (look up: racism). In part because of the Holocaust and the guilt European nations felt.

That's not to say the Palestinians are victims and did everything right. But it is clear they hold less power, yet still, no less than Israel, deserve to have freedom and their own country alongside.

I can assure you however, that this is not a matter of who's blame. I'm a historian. I'm also an atheist. And an Israeli. And I don't know if I can bear to live in Israel much longer. I'm saying this, because nonetheless, I do think there is some special need for a homeland for Jewish people; it really is unique and hard to explain. 

I wish we were accepted wherever we went, history and unfortunately even the present (for example the recent Russia lynch attempts) cast fear into being a Jew, simply because I was born as such.

Ultimately, while it is of historical significance there will never be a strict answer of who's to blame. History is more complex than that. It is my perspective however that no one should hold others accountable when it is clear that their plate is not empty. It just doesn't matter. Do you think any problem will be solved if we blame the ottomans? Or the Brits? Oe the Nazis? Or cold war proxy wars? 

Blaming someone else has never done any good to a nation. Look at Germany after WW2, did they blame the Versailles agreements? Or Hitler himself? No, it took them perhaps a while, but they accepted the horrific things they've done, and came to terms with them, and decided to walk a different path while not forgetting the past.

Both sides need to look inside, acknowledge what they have done wrong, and choose to walk a new road, to form a better future. Unfortunately now it seems so unlikely, it truly hurts to say, my heart legit physically aches thinking of the countless civilians that continue to die and will die in the future.",1
k70prmo,It's funny how quickly the UN loses legitimacy among some people.,1
k70prnx,"Britain engaged in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence with the Arabs , hinting at support for an Arab-led state in return for assistance against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. However, the exact territorial bounds of this promise were not clearly defined. Then, the British issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917, expressing support for a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine but with the caveat that the rights of existing non-Jewish communities would not be prejudiced.

This dual commitment by Britain — first to the Arabs, then to the Jews — sowed seeds of tension and conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine.   


In1947, the UN proposed a partition plan, aiming to create separate Jewish and Arab states from British Mandate Palestine. The Jewish leadership accepted this plan, but the Arab leadership, feeling sidelined and concerned about the implications, rejected it. This rejection did not deter the Jewish leadership, who declared the State of Israel in 1948, prompting the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

At least 700,000 Palestinians faced displacement, an event now known as the Nakbah. This event deepened the schism between Israelis and Palestinians.

In wrapping up, while the essence of these events may seem straightforward, they're embedded in layers of historical, political, and cultural complexities. To genuinely progress towards peace, we must delve deep into these layers, understanding and acknowledging the nuances of the past.",1
k70pr5q,"1) Bombing are a precursor to the ground offensive. That’s how war is waged in every battle. Yes, it helps Israeli troops advance towards the bunkers, command posts and tunnels where Hamas gunmen live. ( Edit: in spite of what you think, no carpet bombing is taking place. Beyond everything, it’s a waste of munition. Majority of strikes are with precision guided bombs) 

2) The Hamas leaders (not a new approach) live far away in safely. No people should agree to this “arrangement”, but it seems Palestinians have no issue with it. 

3) Why would these leaders call for a ceasefire? I can’t see even one reason. For them the people are expendable, cannon fodder for achieving their goal. 

4) Only recently (from the safety of his apartment in Qatar, in an interview to Saudi TV), Khalid Mashaal declared that liberty is achieved with sacrifices.  Palestinians (not him obviously) are willing to sacrifice. So for now, he recommends young Palestinians to sacrify themselves. (aka Allah needs Shahids)… I think it’s a noble cause. 

Only I’d change the order: let Khalid Mashaal, Yahia Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, etc, etc, blow themselves first (to show example) and only later others will follow. How about that?

https://youtu.be/gkZDxJ3JhCA?si=mK-l7fdPsyjdTUyI

Edit: even you can understand (if you try) that Gaza is connected with a network of tunnels (a huge expense - with money that should have gone to the poor population). Entrance to the tunnels is often from inside buildings. So they can fire RPGs, machine guns, etc from the top floor of a building, disappear into a tunnel, then pop up on another side of Gaza. All these plans are courtesy of Ayatollah (with love).

Edit 2: There are thousands of Hamas gunmen, assailants, communication officers, suppliers of munitions and food. 

Since the claim is that they don’t “represent” the population, I was wondering who these people are? On 10/7 a mob invaded Israel (the details are well known). But were these foreigners? Japanese? Mongols? Shaolin monks perhaps? No! These are the sons, brothers, husbands, fathers, neighbors of the people they “don’t represent”…",1

I just saw indescribable, raw footage of Hamas’ massacre along with 100 other international journalists, provided by Israeli authorities. Here are the notes I took: 

1: Hamas terrorist screaming Allah Akhbah as he frantically tries to behead a dead man with a shovel.

2: A father and two sons (roughly 7 &amp; 9) running for their lives in their underwear into what appears to be a bomb shelter with an open entrance. A Hamas terrorist throws a hand grenade into shelter, killing the father, and badly injuring the two sons who run back into the house

3: Hamas terrorists enter a house, where a small girl is seen hiding under the table. After some talking back and forth they shoot and kill her as she hides under the table. Hard to say how old she is but looks like 7-9 years old.
4: Hamas terrorists setting fire to a house in a kibbutz. 

5: A beheaded Israeli soldier. 

6: Photo of dead baby and child burned beyond recognition.

7: Scores of dead people on the road after Hamas executed them in their cars. Yelling Allahu Akhbah. 

8: Hamas terrorist calling his parents: “I killed 10 Jews with my own hands. I’m using the dead Jewish woman’s phone to call you now.” The mother says “May god protect you.”

So many more scenes but I hope you get the gist. The authorities asked is not to film the screening out of respect for the relatives of the Israeli victims. If anyone has any doubt about what happened, I truly don’t know what to say anymore.

Same reason applies to why Hamas has yet to be condemmed by the UN for depriving its citizens of basic essentials like electricity and water.

Just because I was raised in Israel doesn't mean I ""swallow up propaganda"". You know nothing about me. The most important humanitarian organizations reporting about the situation in Gaza and the west bank are Israeli. Does that mean their evaluation should immediately be dismissed?

Additionally, I think I present a fairly nuanced take on the conflict, so even if you think I'm wrong, perhaps you'll learn something new.


The notion that you're not even going to put time into educating yourself on this subject, but here you are preaching to me, is ridiculous. You don't have to be israeli nor Palestinian to comment on the matter, but you do have to do some research and attempt to understand both sides.

Still, I hope that something in you also wants to listen. I will do my best to address your point.

Regarding your points;

1. There are a lot of racists in Israel, religious ultra nationalists who support the superiority of Jews over other religions and ethnicities. I deeply condemn it. People like Ben Gvir and Smotritch who are in power concern me deeply. Nethanyau is also a racist piece of shit. There are also a lot of racist Palestinians who want to eradicate Jews off the face of the earth.

Unfortunately when you live in a region that is filled with so much tension a lot of radical opinions form. Doesn't mean one shouldn't condemn it. I am doing so, and will always do so, especially against racist Israelis, it is despicable.

2. I'm not going to refer much to the claims of ghettoing or genocide. I've tackled those above. But in short, they are unsubstantiated and completely wrong and are only used to try and paint the conflict as black or white.

3. I suggest you don't compare my suffering with others. This isn't a male genital measuring contest for suffering. The Palestinians have suffered more, and still do, I wrote it already. That doesn't take away from my suffering, and ultimately it doesn't matter. 

The notion that one side isn't suffering enough is ridiculous, if more Israeli people die will that satisfy you? If it were 10000 dead Israelis and ""only"" 5000 dead Palestinians would we be ok and moral?

The article is basically a call to “weigh the evidence” before deciding. The actions of Hamas in the immediate aftermath were themselves evidence that Israel had not done it.

No “nationalist” Jewish historian has ever tried to conceal the well-known fact that conversions to Judaism had a major impact on Jewish history in the ancient period and in the early Middle Ages. Although the myth of an exile from the Jewish homeland (Palestine) does exist in popular Israeli culture, it is negligible in serious Jewish historical discussions.

k70kp29,"&gt; Ukrainians were Nazis though? 

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Ukraine greeted them as liberators because of the horrific abuse they had suffered under Stalin, including a deliberate famine that killed millions.  However, the Germans considered Ukrainians just as sub-human as they considered the Russians to be and treated them accordingly.  Thus Ukraine increasingly turned against Germany--there were Ukrainian partisan groups and Ukrainian units within the Red Army.  That some lingering association with Nazism has survived in Ukraine is not surprising, the same thing has happened in many European nations including Russia itself.  Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Croatia and so on, all have neo-Nazi movements.

However, note that there is a difference between Ukrainians being pro-German when they briefly thought the German army was liberating them in 1941, and Ukrainians actually adhering to Nazi ideology.  Even most Germans were not members of the Nazi Party while that party was in power.  Antisemitism is another issue, the Nazis had little trouble finding local helpers in the nations they conquered when it came to rounding up Jews and shipping them off to death camps.",0

k70kfa9,"Bibi is NOT Israel. I have nothing nice to say about him. He should be behind bars. This isn't about believing him. He sucks and should be booted. Israelis en mass have been protesting for months to get him out as his underhanded way of staying in government was to partner with tiny extreme parties that together made up enough for a government. The meaning behind that is complex, but the rule of law and adherence to International law and democratic values is something important for Israelis (vast majority - every culture has extremists). The conversation regarding Palestinians has been 2-State solution by everyone pretty much, with terrorist activities delaying solutions each time new ones were proposed or we were making headway.

Bibi is not the source of information. Can I say again how much I hate him? Palestine was a region. It is not an Arabic name - you can verify this easily. The people living in the region were Jews too. There have always been Jews here, since before Islam existed. That is simply faxt you can verify archeologically. You can also verify that it has been held by empire after empire until the British left and Israel was formed. The Muslim Arabs were also given a chance - they refused. 

Arab Jews had since been expelled violently from neighboring Arab countries, you can check out how many Jews lived in each pre- Israel and how many Post. Take a look at those sports teams I spoke about. Look at images of the coins... 

I will give an alternate pov for the boycotts. The boycotts are actually harming Palestinians most and helping Hamas - those were places employing Palestinians, offering them higher wages than they could get elsewhere in Gaza.

The beheaded babies is true, in fact. I wish it werent so. They raped a 15 yo girl then shot her, leaving seamen on her back and her pants down. In her home. American intelligence, as I understand it, verified the atrocities too. And Israeli morgues verifying identities of bodies also confirm. This is what I think Biden is basing his reactions on. They also burned babies and people alive - friends of mine included. My family escaped by a miracle. Israel is tiny, so if you're wondering why Israelis are out in droves trying to prove this happened, it's not a conspiracy, it's people in pain needing the world to believe them, to see them and to treat them as human beings deserving of life. 

I get you being angry about feeling like America is putting Israel first. Having your country putting people outside before the interests of your own is a problem. It shouldnt be. But then... see the other side - Israel left Gaza in 2005. Hamas was elected as their governing body. They created their own flag. Have their own ministry of education and health and so on. They are the ones who reported on the fatalities from the hospital minutes after it happened.They are given billions in aid. And yet, since Hamas was elected it's been ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"". If you saw the map of Israel, the meaning is clear - destroy Israel. And if you look at Oct 7, then you know what their plans are for everyone here.

Since leaving Gaza, we have had an increasing amount of attacks on civillians and constant bombardments. Not  media news but lived experience. Each time, the walls around Gaza and the restrictions get heavier. Btw, Gaza has a border with Egypt, and they let NOTHING through. So this exceptional pressure on Israel's blockade and only Israel, is causing the rise in sentiment that this is due to antisemitism.

Seeing people chant right now to elliminate Israel especially... it's... I dont actually have words to explain it to you. We are not Bibi. And I promise you, that if you really look, you will find that Hamas is lying. There are such intricate tunnel systems - why no bomb shelters to prevent death? Why no food stores but so many rockets? They dont seem to be running out of those..

Your state has oppressed , stolen from and murdered the rightful inhabitants of that land for 70 years and nothing they do in return is unexpected or undeserved.

Pipes that are within Gaza can only move water around within Gaza or with its borders, which doesn't mean anything if all external sources are shut off and you can't desalinate new water without fuel.  Or if water is turned on on the Israeli side, but you don't have electricity to pump it.

Fundamentally, look at this question.  A tanker is lined up at the border full of water.  Doesn't require anything from Israel.  Why wouldn't they let that in (or Egypt, presumably at their behest)?  That's the dynamic here.  It's not arms, or even fuel, it's just water.",1

It was in Gaza, but that aside, it's pretty crazy to me how Israel leaving Gaza didn't lead to peace. That's such a monumental change for the Palestinians and it turned into more violence.

You can criticize the plan all you like, it doesn't change the fact that it showed Israel that leaving an occupied area wasn't enough to lead to peace, and created a significant terror threat. So the WB unfortunately will remain occupied until the Palestinians can prove that won't happen again in the WB.

You're being a little disingenuous there saying they haven't got much in return. Israel offered them the WB, Gaza, parts of East Jerusalem, neutral control of holy sires, and land swaps to link Gaza and the WB. Abbas turned it down.

That being said, People are just products of their environment. Because so many young Palestinians feel this way, that means if you were born and raised there you probably would feel that way too. I really don't know the best solution, but there's a fundamental humanity of each Palestinian that matters as much as anyone, and it's only one generation of different leaders, ideas, government and education between current Palestinian attitudes and future ones of peace and tolerance.

These things escalated and drove Jews to necessitate their own state. Things could have been different if Arabs back then didn't all sign onto Pan-Arab ideology and antisemitism so easily.

Things can still be different. But it requires de-escalation on all sides and governments that respect their populations, denounce violence, and grant individual freedoms. Yeah right now we don't have that. Hopefully one day. In the mean time all we can do is fight against terrorism and fascism, and at the moment Hamas is the worst perpetrator of this.

Gaza is what it looks like when they’re left to their own devices. Billions pour in in aid every single year, and Hamas and the “martyrs” families are all well fed, while the rest deal with the consequences of their actions. 

It’s a victimhood machine that’s run by a death cult who realizes that the best and easiest way for them to continue funding their religious war is to garner global support and aid via the deaths and victimization of their own civilians. 

They do things that directly lead to more people dying and then turn around and point a finger at Israel. The crazy part is that it works. 

You have likely seen all the evidence at this point, but you’re not arguing based off of evidence, only pure conjectures, and you’ve made it clear that you don’t feel as if israel should exist. You assume that Hamas will disappear, and the people who were dancing in the streets around dead bodies will magically turn into flower sniffers. 

This is the single most misinformed take on the conflict I’ve seen yet. 

It’s a direct mirror of the famous quote:

“If the Arab lay down their arms there would no more war, but if Israel lays down its weapons there would be no more Israel.”

It was first said by Golda Meir and it’s been repeated countless times. 

However, you flipped it but your version has no veracity. Muslims extremists have been Massacring Jews and any other non Muslim populations that won’t submit to their religious rule since the first Islamic Extremists existed. 


You’re so tolerant of the intolerant. It’s truly perplexing. You think that they share your fundamental values, and they, as a population, really don’t. The majority of them would vote for Hamas today, the reason being that the PLO is willing to exist with Israel, and is less violent. They want the extremely violent destruction of Israel, a real genocide, but then cry “genocide” when their actions have consequences. I’m talking about how they keep civilians packed in known bombing targets, and then point a finger at Israel for the unhinged death toll. They lie about the veracity of the bomb warnings, and if that doesn’t work, they violently enforce a lockdown of evacuation routes. They even bombed their own hospital and then blamed the deaths on Israel, and you probably still believe them to this day. One side has provided objective evidence (Israel) and the other side points a finger at Israel and screams genocide after having murdered a bunch of their own civilians. 

Most of the war crimes you blame Israel for are just Hamas doing their best to manufacture victimhood. It’s a product that you and others suck up from your couches, and you can’t get enough of it. 

Another Hamas defender in a comment early today  put it aptly. They said something along the lines of “don’t talk to me about war crimes.” 

You love your comfortable version of being the good guy, so go ahead and post a flag, but remember, you think the people who raped women, burned them alive, executed families including children, executed the bound and the elderly, and discriminately attacked only civilian targets known to be lacking in defense, will just up and disappear if Israel does.

&gt; Sharon suggested his disengagement plan for the first time on December 18, 2003 at the Fourth Herzliya Conference. In his address to the Conference, Sharon stated that ″settlements which will be relocated are those which will not be included in the territory of the State of Israel in the framework of any possible future permanent agreement. At the same time, in the framework of the Disengagement Plan, Israel will strengthen its control over those same areas in the Land of Israel which will constitute an inseparable part of the State of Israel in any future agreement.″[14] It was at this time that he began to use the word ""occupation"". Bernard Avishai states that the Gaza withdrawal was designed to obviate rather than facilitate peace negotiations: Sharon enivisaged at the same time annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and the major settlements like Ma'ale Adumim and Ariel which he had in the meantime developed, and thereby isolate Palestinians on the West Bank in territory that constituted less than half of what existed beyond the Green Line.

Today we have the PA in the West Bank, which has recognized Israel statehood for years. They have been and continue to be a good partner to Israel and open to a two-state solution.

This isn’t (or at least, as of the information a publicly available yet, always room for more horror I guess) an attempt to destroy a sector of land, or indiscriminate killing or annihilation. Killing and annihilation are obvious (grotesque) results, but not the operational intention.

saying targeted bombing is accurate. Highlighting the real cost to property, land, infrastructure and human life- also accurate. Using “carpet bombing” implies a carelessness, heedless and ultimately different motivation. It removes the context, makes discussion of what is happening reduce itself to “they have too many bombs and itchy trigger fingers”, and this mindset stalls humanitarian relief efforts from being “urgent necessity to provide civilian evacuation and necessary supplies“ to being “stop all illegal and inhuman military operations against Hamas“ with Palestinian civilians being used But not helped.

Israel should have responded to the October 7th attack much more quickly and professionally. Reportedly took over 6 hours for forces to arrive. And several of the rave survivors say that IDF was shooting wildly into the crowd and is responsible for many of the deaths.

The difference with this conflict in my opinion is the change in social media to favor hd video format. That means that the thing that pulls us as humans out of the revenge part of the cycle and into the compassion part (seeing the devastation and the humanity of those involved) is readily accessible. On the larger global scale, people without intense ties to either state are being impacted by what they’re seeing and that’s why these protests/calls for ceasefire are so huge. 

With tensions so high among the communities involved, many of the people whose opinions are the most impactful to the situation, hand wave every video of a Palestinian off as Hamas propaganda.

You're correct. Just like Europe is called Europe. Palestine was called Palestine since 132 AD, when Empror Hadrian changed the region's name from Judea to Syria-Palestina in order to erase the Jewish connection to the land.

&gt;Yes Palestine was never a “Nation state” as we know it, but they helped the British defeat their own government/military (the ottomans) in exchange for independence and autonomy. The British backstabbed them and promised the land to European settlers to make independent, then when there were rising tensions, the British demanded the arabs don’t take independence and wait for the British.

1. The British Mandate of Palestine included the area also known as Jordan, so the Jews were promised only a tiny bit of silver from a big land.

2. The land known today as Israel/Palestine was heavily depopulated. Yes there were people there. But there was enough room for both nations.

&gt;When the British were ran out by immigrant Jewish militias, the UN was in the middle of determining the extent of self determination of Palestinians which is an international requirement if you want to establish a new modern day nation.

The Palestinian identity only came to be in 1964. Roughly a decade and a half after the formation of Israel. Beforehand, the Arab plan for the region was to create a ""Greater Syria"". After the 1948 war, Jordan annexed the West Bank, and Egypt placed a military control over Gaza. Even then it wasn't quite Palestinian land. (Yes they owned some of it, but they weren't governed by themselves).

And the British were driven out by the endless attacks between Jews and Arabs. 

&gt;The Palestinians declined giving away half their land

It wasn't their land. As I've said before. Most of it was empty and ""state owned"" land.

&gt;and the US warned Israel not to declare independence since the UN was in the middle of sorting out the issue.

Hilarious. The UN dropped the matter after resolution 181. And wasn't in the middle of ""sorting out the issue"". Not sure who told you that.

&gt;arabs were patiently waiting for a decision when Israel decided to unlawfully declare independence and immediately started taking half the land before they rightfully were resisted.

Hahaha. The Arabs attacked the Jews the day after the UN resolution was decided, in the Fajja bus attack. The UN never resolved nor did it try to resolve the matter. And the 181 resolution became the de-facto plan. Followed through by the Jews, rejected by the Arabs. 

They weren't rightfully resisted, they agreed to share the land. The Arabs and their colonial ambitions refused and started a war of extermination, wishing to continue the Holocaust in Israel.

&gt;Not a word i said is factually untrue and there’s nothing relevant that i left out.

I think that aside from the first paragraph about the name of the region, everything else you said was very untrue. You've left a whole lot out, and straight up lied as well.

I literally mentioned that in my comment... there is one snippet of footage that appears in all the articles on the topic depicting one pipe being excavated. We don't know where that pipe was, or if it was even connected to anything. And as I said earlier, it's still scummy for Hamas to be building rockets out of anything, I just think the ""Hamas build rockets out of pipes, better collectively punish everyone"" is a convenient narrative that gets exaggerated in order to avoid thinking through the humanitarian consequences of the situation.

&gt; since you probably didn't even read the article

I certainly did read the article. The whole thing is a hit-piece on the notion of providing humanitarian aid to Palestine, from a paper that has a strong pro-Israel perspective: 

&gt; While the Telegraph cannot independently verify the exact weapons used in the mass bombardment, it has raised fears over whether Western-donated building supplies could have been used to manufacture some of the munitions.

""Raised fears"", ""could have"", ""cannot verify"".

&gt; You want solid verification of this being wide scale? Look at the number of rockets they've launched into Israel- it's over tens of thousands.

This is self-contradictory. How much piping is in Gaza? How much do you think has been turned into rockets? Because if it's on the scale that you're implying they would have had literally no pipes left years ago.

First of all l want to make clear that l am against previous and current crimes of both parties of this mess, citizens and leaders. I am not supporting either party, I am supporting reason and justice, and l do fight against double standards. I am from Northern Europe myself, but l have dug deep into this for long and know people from the region. 

The attack of Hamas was totally barbaric. Also the collective revenge on Gaza at the moment is out of proportion and causes damage and death MOSTLY to people that were not guilty in any way.

I have noticed in this sub that fanatic supporters of Israel seem very aggressive and find all kinds of excuses for the collective revenge. Using that logic it would be best to nuke whole Middle East to the ground, who cares if ""a few civilians"" would go along, as long as the bad guys on both sides are destroyed. For people outside the region it would be ok, if we follow the logic. 

When l present this analogy, l see that the fanatic Israel supporters basically explode in rage. It is basically and unfortunately very telling. I am really sad that both Hamas and lsrael see that the only way is escalation.

Even if things are very complicated, there are always better things to do than collective revenge (from any side). If this goes on, the craziness will never stop

I don’t mean to offend, I think ultimately you have a great point- typically called a “binational” state- some have argued to remove the favored status of “Jewish character” of the country and make a state for the two nations. It is a form of idealism that, with hope, may one day be possible, but it is very far down the road- it would take generations, huge concessions, and ultimately isn’t a viable solution to current tensions. It also assumes there are numbers enough on both sides willing to concede deeply held beliefs or demands which neither has indicated they are willing to do. Western minds look at divided land, draw more lines and figure “the locals“ were too stupid to come up with a solution- this does not lead to peace.

the most immediate concern (or, counterpoint?) is the reality of intense tribalism. This cannot be legislated out of existence. Tensions between different groups (try to set aside ”religion” as a concept and replace it with “social group”) are feverpitched in many places. Though there are substantial numbers in differing groups who are willing to make peace work, they are still not the majority. 

on the Jewish side, a common retort to this plan is the insecurity and imminent danger perceived in not having a “Jewish state”. It has been called “Jewish supremacy”, but I think that is kind of reductive. In essence it is about sovereignty, and the defense and freedom of the Jewish people (I’m not arguing for or against here, this is just the idea). Many Israelis feel that without a “Jewish majority”, a democratic state will naturally evolve to represent its most numerous, engaged and motivated population. the state could evolve to become a Muslim majority, placing a Jewish minority in a dangerous position (and anyone who denies the danger of Jews as a minority in the Middle East are, well…bless your heart). To argue that Palestinians do \*not\* want a Muslim character to their state is to argue in bad faith and against the clearly stated intentions of a majority of Palestinian voices.

the mechanics of sharing a state involve whatever each side demands-  for Palestinians, I’ve never heard a significant amount of Palestinians urge for less that the right of return, which is roughly 7 million. That’s a huge influx of people from around the world, mostly currently in Arab countries, and to decline this is a no-go for most Palestinians. It’s also a nonstarter for most Israelis. Even with a new, guaranteed “safety and representation for all” constitution, you are moving toward a state of 50% Jewish, 50% Palestinian population, stuffed with suspicion, grievance, anger and political willpower. Maybe tomorrow the constitution says “zero discrimination, zero religious persecution”. Cool. After 4 elections it becomes “religious tolerance and freedom”. 5 court cases later the Supreme Court amends it to say “no compelled action against X person’s social beliefs. Now it morphs to “Muslim schools vs Jewish schools, fired legally for working on a holy day, manager fires gay employee upheld under new “religious freedom law”. Jewish landlord successfully argues against providing housing to Muslim family. Etc. over time, this gets worrying. These are all very familiar headlines already.

palestinians would be expected to, over night, accept a westernized culture that many may find uncomfortable. This ranges from public life, modesty, gender relations, lgbtqia+ tolerance and minority autonomy. Daughter went out drinking with Christian boyfriend. Son got high school girlfriend pregnant on the coed school trip.   


land Rights, including redistribution of all land (say 300,000 Palestinian refugees from Akko are returned next month (some from camps in Lebanon, some from Gaza, some from West Bank)- all dropped into Akko tomorrow. Logistics are intense- living arrangements, jobs, are there enough apartments? Did the family who owns the building agree to any property rights sharing? Will someone from a Lebanese camp feel comfortable paying a Jewish landlord? There is just so much involved in just this one scenario that could take years to hammer out. It’s just one city.

what about reparations? Will there be an agreement based on land lost in 48? How does one prove their entitlement to it? A national “returned peoples fund” (This is actually a reasonable solution, but funding and disbursement is a nightmare).

what about social conflict? After years of violence, is it fair to expect either group to be comfortable sharing buses? Is it unreasonable to expect, at least for the first, say, 10 years, breakout violence? Will the majority agree to just let the final dregs of public killings, escalating fights leading to stabbing, disagreements and self segregating, the occasional bomb on an ambulance- will they just agree to ride those out? Each flare up will spark another.

Humanity means that like any other group of people they’re fallible, not monolithic, and because of that, the population still deserves a right to life. 

Of course you felt relief at the start when you saw Israel struck back, most humans would in the face of a heinous terrorist attack. There’s no fault in that. A lot of Americans felt the same in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. Much less Americans feel that way about it now with the gift of hindsight. 

But what stands out with your viewpoint is that it gives us room to recognize that as much relief as you got from seeing this strike back in the beginning, the devastation of the strikes are horrifying. And we know that when a population experiences something truly horrifying, something that makes them feel unsafe and causes their whole body to enter survival mode, they’re likely to feel relief when their side strikes back.

k70ad48,"&gt;I don't think the Palestinians were all that serious either.  One of the reasons I never considered the 2SS all that viable.  Any 2SS would either be horribly opposed by one side or majority opposed by both.

I disagree but my issue is specifically with Likud's fundamental lack of interest in a serious 2ss regardless of how willing Palestinians were. If all Palestinians suddenly became complete moderates who would be completely happy with a Palestinian state including the West Bank, Gaza strip and at least parts of east Jerusalem, Likud wouldn't be interested.

&gt;The Israeli right doesn't talk in terms of ""right to the entire region"" in the sense the left does.

I mean the original 1977 party platform of Likud literally states:

""The Right of the Jewish People to the Land of Israel (Eretz Israel) a. The right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is eternal and indisputable and is linked with the right to security and peace; therefore, Judea and Samaria will not be handed to any foreign administration; between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.

b. A plan which relinquishes parts of western Eretz Israel, undermines our right to the country, unavoidably leads to the establishment of a ""Palestinian State,"" jeopardizes the security of the Jewish population, endangers the existence of the State of Israel. and frustrates any prospect of peace.""

From the 1999 party platform you used an excerpt of above:

""The Jordan river will be the permanent eastern border of the State of Israel. The Kingdom of Jordan is a desirable partner in the permanent status arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians in matters that will be agreed upon.""

&gt;I think it will. What happened to Normans, Aquitaines and Burgunians?

I'm not very familiar with that history. What policies applied to these people do you think can also work with Palestinians?

My argument has a lot of solid backing, despite multiple attempts at ignoring and trying to diminish the political issues involving Palestinians it always came back to bite Israel eventually in a cyclic pattern. I'm not even sure what your proposal is, unless theres some form of actionable plan similar to what was applied to the groups of people you brought up, which so far seems to be just ignoring them or in essence just the the status quo, it will result in similar results again and again. Some time in the next few months or years we'll be talking again about how upsetting 'the cycle of violence' is.

Israelis and pro-Israelis would rather pursue oppressive policies that have been tested and failed over and over again rather than bother having discussions centering around Palestinian rights because having your cake and eating it too where Israelis get maximum comfort for as little concessions as possible all at the expense of Arabs is at the heart of Israeli society and is probably one of the more repulsive things about their society honestly. They want to uphold a pseudo-liberal-democracy while controlling virtually the entire region but only apply these democratic principles for a select portion of the people in the region while leaving millions of Palestinians as poor disenfranchised residents under direct or indirect oppressive military rule. It's like at least try picking between a genuine good-faith liberal democracy and the whole land, whats with pretending Israel has both?

&gt;Remove the systematic supports for Palestinian nationalism and Palestinian becomes an ethnic not a national identity. Go further and it becomes part of the ethnic background of Israelis, a historical features.

Okay, how do you plan on doing that?

&gt;You mean like what is happening with Israeli-Arabs as they are entering the middle class.

The Arab-Israeli middle class is comparatively small to the Jewish middle class. I'm not sure that would always be the case with West Bank Palestinians in the mix in whatever political framework is being imagined.

&gt;To be middle class generally requires a lot of assimilation. A society can tilt the field so that is even more true. An assimilated middle class demanding rights doesn't endanger the system it strengthens it.

Okay, I'm not even sure what political framework all this happens in, but if we're talking about a form of a traditional 1ss what happens when the millions of Arabs in the west bank start breaking into the middle class still clinging onto Palestinian or Arab nationalism? Unless you propose to ban people from entering university if they hold certain political beliefs like supporting of a 2ss or giving special taxes people with 'unorthodox' opinions how will you protect against a strong nationally conscious Arab middle class?

&gt;When the Irish demanded rights or later when blacks did it made American more in line with its ideals not less. When a Zionist ethnically Palestinian middle class demands rights it makes Israel more not less Zionist

The issue you're missing is that they might not be Zionists. They might just be members of an ethnically Palestinian middle class demanding national rights and a state. You can either avoid it or establish a society using non-democratic means to subvert this.

&gt;They were friendly neighbors in the 1950s and 60s. Then they started mixing for 2 generations and everyone is just Israeli. Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, especially among the non-Haredi population are ceasing to exist as distinct populations.

My argument there was more of a semantic one but in regards to this ashkenazi and mizrahi jews have far more in common with each other than arabs and jews.

&gt;We disagree. I think you are dead wrong on this. Read some of the classic right.

What do you consider to be 'the classic right'?

&gt;Don't see it. If anything he is arguing the opposite. The enemy aren't idiots. They aren't going to sell out their interests cheaply or easily...

Correct. The racial superiority in question is in regards to the belief of innate moral superiority of the jewish cause over whatever the Arab cause or demands were.

&gt;Don't confuse racist with desiring to win. Napoleon wasn't racist against the Germans, British and Russians.

I'm not confusing them. I think they're fundamentally tied, yes he had a desire to win in establishing a maximalist Jewish state whatever the cost may be on the Arab end. He was letting his ethnic bias leak through to his policy decisions. The policy he was trying to win in enforcing reeks of racism. Napoleon may have not believed Germans were merely intellectually inferior backwards pseudo-civilization types but regardless he had no problem bastardizing the holy roman empire into a series of French client states at the expense of Germans or whatever aspirations they had or were going to have for the benefit of French imperialism.",0

k70a58b,"On double standards, collective punishment and ""logic""

First of all l want to make clear that l am against previous and current crimes of both parties of this mess, citizens and leaders. I am not supporting either party, I am supporting reason and justice, and l do fight against double standards. I am from Northern Europe myself, but l have dug deep into this for long and know people from the region. 

The attack of Hamas was totally barbaric. Also the collective revenge on Gaza at the moment is out of proportion and causes damage and death MOSTLY to people that were not guilty in any way.

I have noticed in this sub that fanatic supporters of Israel seem very aggressive and find all kinds of excuses for the collective revenge. Using that logic it would be best to nuke whole Middle East to the ground, who cares if ""a few civilians"" would go along, as long as the bad guys on both sides are destroyed. For people outside the region it would be ok, if we follow the logic. 

When l present this analogy, l see that the fanatic Israel supporters basically explode in rage. It is basically and unfortunately very telling. I am really sad that both Hamas and lsrael see that the only way is escalation.

Even if things are very complicated, there are always better things to do than collective revenge (from any side). If this goes on, the craziness will never stop 

And by the way...even if l am far away from lsrael and Gaza, I see what happens can escalate to affect the whole world. That is why I present this analogy. Human kind does not seem to be able to grow up, and now it would really be needed.

What happens now is far from ""precision""",1

When the British were ran out by immigrant Jewish militias, the UN was in the middle of determining the extent of self determination of Palestinians which is an international requirement if you want to establish a new modern day nation. The Palestinians declined giving away half their land, and the US warned Israel not to declare independence since the UN was in the middle of sorting out the issue. arabs were patiently waiting for a decision when Israel decided to unlawfully declare independence and immediately started taking half the land before they rightfully were resisted.

k7094h2,"This systemic attempt to use loaded words when discussing Israel constantly horrified me.

A simple example is ""apartheid"", a term originally describing racial segregation in South Africa and Namibia, a term that has been appropriated cynically to describe Israel, and only Israel, despite many other countries having far clearer examples of ""apartheid-esque"" characteristics; look Turkish treatment of Kurds, Chinese treatment of Uyghurs etc.

The claim ""genocide"" has 0 basis. The claim that Israel is bombing a city indiscriminately has no basis whatsoever. Genocide has actually a strict legal definition, you can look it up if you want. 

The claim ""white European settlers"" is perhaps the most insulting. Most Israeli jews are of Mizrahi descent (meaning Middle Eastern or North African), most Israeli jews are refugees. 900,000 Mizrahi Jews immigrated as a result of as you like to use that word so much, ethnic cleansing. Other Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, have mainly immigrated as a result of pogroms in Eastern Europe or the Holocaust. 

The hate for Jews throughout history is crucial to understand if you truly want to understand this conflict, Zionism, the establishment of Israel.

Personally, I think that your view is extremist and ridiculous. If Native Americans demanded their homeland back today, took up arms and went to claim it with force would you let them kill you? If you've said yes, in order to have some twisted sense of moral consistency, I can assure you that you wouldn't. It is especially simple to criticize other people fearing for their lives when you don't have to fear for yours.

Crimes committed by your forefathers should have no bearing on your future, likewise, crimes have been committed by Israeli Jews against Palestinians, there is no way around it. Some crimes are still being committed. I condemn the treatment of Palestinians in the west bank. The Nakba is rightfully a tragic event, but two wrongs don't make a right. Crimes of ethnic cleansing being committed nearly a century ago doesn't justify ethnic cleansing of 8 million people today. 

The notion that Israel has no right to exist is not only racist (as, even if not considered antisemitic, Israelis can also be described as an ethnic group) it is also stupid, plain stupid, and impractical. Israelis have no home to return to. Israel was established so that most of them have one. Will (probably about, an approximation) 4 million Israeli Jews of Mizrahi descent go live back in Syria, Turkey, Iraq?

Some Jewish communities have existed for thousands of years in peace with Muslims but were forced out. 

Israel isn't an ethnostate, as all citizens have equal rights. The only difference is the right of return for Jews and establishment of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people. This doesn't classify as an ethnostate, considering that again, all citizens have equal rights and ethnostate is by definition ""a sovereign state of which citizenship is restricted to members of a particular racial or ethnic group"".

Also, just to be technical, since you care so much about it, Hamas technically committed crimes against humanity, which is different from war crimes in their definition.

The west doesn't, but it should, differentiate between Gaza and the West Bank, the situation in each is completely different.

All of these words, all of these labels, all of which are either inaccurate or incorrect do the entire world a massive disservice. Because they don't intend to further discussion.

If you have no empathy for dead innocent civilians, wherever they are in the world, you should take a deep look inside and reevaluate your values and what you stand for.

Last but not least, people often like to paint this conflict as ""oppressor vs oppressed"", ""good vs evil"" (from both sides), ""victim vs perpetrator"". All of these are an attempt to simplify what is a complex conflict, it is people's lives.

Palestinians suffer more from the conflict than Israelis do, there's no way around it. That doesn't justify Israeli suffering. This conflict is not simple. I don't care about the twisted TikTok algorithm you've spiraled into or whatever, these are people's lives that people all around the world but especially in America, just love to oversimplify.

Using white phosphorus in populated civilian areas? When they consistently say that Hamas are hiding underground, so how will it even hurt them? But it does hurt innocent people, and it’s a war crime.

Cutting of access to basic human essentials, water and food? And blocking their access to any humanitarian aid? There are babies, children and pregnant women and elderly people, and sick and disabled people. Another war crime. How can that be justified just to “find Hamas”?

Bombing UN schools and UNWRA warehouses? Not acceptable. Bombing churches? Another war crime.

All of the above things risk the lives of the hostages that were taken, and people are desperate to get home safely. Surely all these things could kill some of them if not all of them at some point?

Hamas did terrible things, that’s not disputed. But Israel’s government, and military are clearly punishing innocent civilians for the crimes of Hamas. And that’s disgusting.

k708yn4,"Again you are looking at it wrong. What is the goal of keep doing it?

Since we left Gaza 2005, it's not our responsible for the water of Gaza. They had plenty of clean aquifers to pull from, and the UN and Israel supplied them with the infrastructure to pump water from them. But after Hamas took over, they removed most of the pipe to create rockets from (and it's something we blame them of doing, it's something they proudly [posted videos about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvvqBcA-9yA)), and used the remaining pipe for both clean water and sewage.  
The result? The aquifers became polluted.

Then Israel started selling them water at a subsidized cost (cheaper than it cost us to pump it and cheaper than Israeli citizens pay for it), and continued doing so even when the Gazan government failed to pay to years, with a debt almost at $1B.  
And don't get me wrong, it was from a goodness of heart from our government, nor as a part of working towards peace. Unfortunately, our government don't put it as a priority. No, they done it as they thought it will help deescalate the situation with Gaza, and help things stabilised.

Well, since 7/10, things have escalated. So, why keep doing so?

And again, don't get me wrong, I don't want Gazan to suffer, but it's not Israel's responsibly to supply them with water. It was a transaction, that ended up fruitless. So why keep doing so?

And at a certain point They opened up the water pipe to the south, and yesterday or today (not sure) they built a second pipe, to increase the flow, as the goal is not to kill people, so we are doing it to save lives that we are not responsible for, but at the same time started finding other solutions, so we won't do it anymore, and other countries will. Because we have no more reason, no goal, in continuing doing so.",0

All the similar articles I've seen have relied on one PIJ terrorist guy bragging about how they're so clever they could even use water pipes to make rockets, and a single video of somebody digging up one pipe.

If someone has a source that actually provides solid verification of this on a wide scale I'd be interested to see it, but so far it seems like something that has possibly happened a couple of times (still reprehensible obviously) and has been blown into a generalised talking point to justify punitive action or collective punishment.",1

They denied killing the journalist Shereen Abu Akleh, then when investigations showed that they did it, they were like “yeah okay we did it”.

In 1968's Al Karameh battle against Jordan, the official Israeli number for casualties is “28-33 dead and 69-161 wounded” also in their official numbers “27 tanks destroyed and 4 left behind, 2-4 APCs destroyed, 2 vehicles and 1 aircraft” and denied that any of their soldiers were captured. And there is no detailed report nor documents about the battle, and they even claim to have won that battle.

When in reality, Jordan has public documents and reports that go in boring details as well as voice and radio recordings of the whole battle, they have the list of 250 dead Israeli soldiers, their names and their positions in their museums, also countless images of the casualties and 30+ soldiers captured by Jordan, and so many other details that show Israel’s lying at its best, I can go into detail if you'd like.

Israel also withdrew randomly against their orders, and they haven’t achieved a single goal of their offense but lost their reputation.

k706u78,"&gt; Its weakness and inability to defend Palestinian lives has been highlighted by the bloodshed since 7 October. Shtayyeh insisted, however, that it would never abandon non-violence to regain popularity.

&gt; “[Abbas] can be popular in one minute,” the prime minister said. “He can say: ‘OK, I order the Palestinian security forces to shoot at the Israelis.’ But he is a realistic man.”

&gt; However, Shtayyeh acknowledged that anger was mounting rapidly among Palestinians, and that the situation on the West Bank was “boiling” and becoming “seriously dangerous”, leaving the PA stuck between a furious population and a violent and callous Israeli government.

&gt; “We are caught between the rock and the hammer,” he said.

A huge part of the reason why the PA is unpopular among Palestinians is because it cannot and will not protect them against Israeli violence and ever growing settlements taking Palestinian land.

This is also why Hamas can be considered more “popular” - they promise to protect Palestinians from Israeli aggression. Now the way they do this is by unjustifiable terrorism means, but it explains why Palestinians may be more inclined to be sympathetic to a government that at least claims to protect them.

If Israel wants peace, they need to immediately start normalizing relations with the PA. They need to pledge to start dismantling illegal settlements. They need to show that the PA is a viable option for the Palestinian people that will bring peace and security.",1

As much as I don’t like Hamas: saying they don’t care about Palestinians is a little silly, after all they were democratically elected by the citizens of Gaza. I just think it’s counterproductive to focus on their crimes because it turns the focus away from the primary crime that’s happening.

The claims about Hamas hiding among civilians is also overblown. There have been many cases in which the Israeli military has bombed media companies, hospitals and so on and just claimed Hamas was in there without any proof whatsoever.

You sound quite naive, so I intended to respond in an entirely different manner until I read that comment. Now I’m just disgusted by your ignorance and disregard for human life. Wishing terror attacks on the West, when our leaders (against most of our wishes) loudly and proudly support Netanyahu. 

Go and view the footage of the dead Palestinian babies that lie still across Gaza. It’s widely available and it’s traumatising to scroll across that by accident. So many tiny, lifeless bodies. A large number of them are missing heads or limbs, others whose limbs are the only pieces found. The footage of all the screaming, crying orphans, covered in dust and the blood of their families. The footage of civilian apartment buildings, completely flattened with residents still inside. 

Go and watch the interview with the Norwegian doctor who categorically states that there has never been any shred of evidence of Hamas presence or control in those hospitals, in the decades that he and his colleagues have worked there - strictly operating under the Geneva convention. The hospitals Israel are threatening to bomb, despite knowing that this alone will kill 14,000+ civilians - and many more, through removal of their access to medical treatment. Repeated “warnings” do not grant medical staff the ability to evacuate sick and dying patients, when there is nowhere safe to go and there are no resources available. 

Israel are committing war crimes against an entire population in retaliation for a terrorist attack carried out by a minority. They do this knowing there are Israeli hostages in those tunnels and in Palestinian homes. Netanyahu’s vengeance trumps human life, whether that life is Palestinian or Israeli.

k703mhc,"Let me try to clarify this because prior to October 7th I also bought into a lot of the BS pro Palestinians lines. If you really are interested let me explain what I've learned so far. 

1.  Genocide is the deliberate killing or severe mistreatment of a large number of people from a particular national or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group. Israel has not done this. There are 2 million Palestinians (who are full citizens)  living in israel. They have the highest standard of living out of any palestinian group in the Arab world.  They represent 20% of the government,  sit on the supreme court and have high ranking military positions.  Every day tens of thousands more come from Palestine to work. The entire Palestinian population Israel, Gaza, and Palestine has increased about 5x.  

This is not a genocide. If we are talking about occupied west bank, that population too is increasing. Palestinians there are discriminated against, they have hardships because of military checkpoints and there is violence with conflicts with the IDF.  It is not the systematic killing of innocent people.  If Palestinians in the west bank had accepted and followed Oslo and not launched the second intifada, they would be celebrating their 30th day of independence last year.  

2. Occupation.  After Oslo which the palestinians agreed to, the west bank was split into three regions. A B and C.  C would remain occupied militarily while there was a deescalation of tensions, and terrorist groups (hezbola) would be routed out.  Arafat did not do this and the Israelis created illegal settlements on the borderlands of area C.  The deal fell apart and Israel is still occupying.  But there were offers to leave many times. Israel does not want to be there. 

Gaza is not an occupied territory.  I don't know who is arguing at Harvard that it is, but there is not a single Jew living there except for the hostages.  Gaza was given to the Palestinians in a land for peace deal in 2005.  They had total control to do what they want.  In 2007 they voted in Hamas and Israel built a border - like all other countries.  Even still, trade continued.  Up until Oct 7, thousands of Gazans crossed into Israel ever say for work.  If you argue that Israel controls the skies, I'd argue that south Korea does this too and is not occupying north Korea.

3. Apartheid.  This one is really awful when I saw what was happening.  The UN created a special rapporteur made up of 24 antisemitic countries with human rights violations. Syria, north Korea, Russia, lebanon, Afghanistan, etc.   They also changed the definition of apartheid to be something completely different than south African apartheid.  All these countries signed off on their report. No one else in the UN did.  Keep in mind the UN has a pretty horrific record of these types of things. Amnesty international followed suit claiming apartheid in area C.

So you have an international report from dubious countries that all claim their atrocities are fine, stating that apartheid (but not south Africa apartheid) is taking place. And the only country in the world this is happening in is Israel - a democracy no less.  Not Syria, or North Korea, or Afghanistan or Iraq - but Israel.  Amnesty international is the same deal.  Not a single other country has come under their new special definition of apartheid.  So yes I call BS on that too.  As did the US recently when they overwhelmingly passed a motion rejecting the UN and these NGOs claims. You can argue that thats part of a JeWiSh CoNsPiRaCy but then I think you've lost the plot.  

Hope this helps and please reach out if I got anything wrong of you have questions.  I sincerely felt like you one month ago and now realize how I was tricked.",0

TLDR; most of those times that people call peace negotiation there wasn't a Palestinian delegation, when it was Israel requested ridiculous things like access over water supply, complete demilitarization , airspace control, movement control, right to have an army on the ground, control over agricultural land in Gaza, a ridiculous amount of land and historical significant cities of Palestinians , \* always wanting to expand settlement\* , cashing in on TVA. Almost none of the times important issues like borders of a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements were discussed. No sane delegation of a country would accept another country to have that much control over their own.

&gt;1949 Armistice

The Palestinians did not have direct representation in these negotiations. It was an armistice to halt the fighting not a peace settlement.

&gt;1967 Allon Plan

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

included significant territorial expansion into the West Bank and Gaza Strip,it was made to enable an Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem, the Etzion Bloc, and most of the Jordan Valley. All remaining parts of the West Bank, containing the majority of Palestinians, were to be returned to Jordan

&gt;Roger's plan

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

Rogers Plan called for a ceasefire and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied during the Six-Day War in 1967. It proposed that Israel would return to the pre-war borders with minor modifications in exchange for peace agreements with its Arab neighbors. Again, *there were no palestinian representatives* did not directly address the Palestinian issue, it addressed Israel relations with Arab neighbors. It didn't work out because Israel wasn't too keen on returning to its pre-1967 borders, and some Arab states wanted a solution that includes a state for Palestinians.

&gt;Geneva 73

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

The conference's focus was on broader Arab-Israeli relations, it involved Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and the United States as the mediator.

&gt;1978 Camp David Accords

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

It was between Egypt and Israel, nothing to do with Palestine. The accords did not address core Palestinian concerns

PLO was not part of the negotiations

Even The UN General Assembly rejected the Framework

&gt;1979 Egypt treaty

The Palestinians did not have direct representation

The upper accords lead to this treaty so it's basically the same thing

&gt;Madrid

The Palestinians did not have direct\* representation

the first time that Israelis and Palestinians engaged in direct, face-to-face talks *except* it was by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team. The focus was primarily on negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, with the understanding that the Palestinian issue would be addressed *later* in the process

&gt;Oslo accords

Which are super important as this time it was really PLO standing there . There is a lot to read about it

PLO recognized Istrael as a state that has the right to exist but Israel recognized PLO only as the representative of the Palestinian people, not as a legitimate government

Under the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into three zones: Area A, Area B, and Area C, each with different levels of Palestinian self-rule and Israeli military presence:

Area A: Under full Palestinian civil and security control. Area B: Under Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli-Palestinian security control. Area C: Under full Israeli civil and security control.

But there was a problem, Israel was supposed to withdraw its army and while it did withdraw it from some places, it did it very slowly and in some other places not at all, all the while continuing the agressive expansion of illegal settlements. In 2002 Israeli army re-occupied what it gave to palestinian control anyway.

Moreover the Olso accords did not address core status issues, such as the borders of a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements etc

&gt;1994 Jordan peace treaty

Yeah...this was exactly that, between Jordan and Israel and had stuff like drugs, border crossing, environmental issues etc. Nothing to do with Palestine

&gt;Oslo II Accord (1995)

Israel was opposed to an extended international presence in the territories, which Palestinians wanted as a buffer and for it to monitor Israeli activities.

&gt;2000 Camp David Summit

While Palestinians accepted to keep only 22% of the original historic Palestine, Israel wanted more.

Palestinian negotiators accepted the Green Line borders (1949 armistice lines) for the West Bank but the Israelis rejected this proposal

Israel was not willing to cede sovereignty over East Jerusalem, including the Old City, to the Palestinians. The Palestinians sought East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state and it was a historical holy place.

Israel wanted that historically important Arab neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and at-Tur would remain under Israeli sovereignty

Israel suggested annexing approximately 9% of the West Bank, particularly areas with large settlement blocks, and in return offered land from the Negev desert, which is less valuable.

Israel was opposed to the Right of Return of Palestinians and said that any right of return would pose a threat to Israel's *Jewish character*

*Israel wanted also to be allowed to use its airspace of Palestine the right to deploy troops on Palestinian territory*

*Israel also demanded that the Palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of police,*

*Israel sought control over the main water aquifers located in the West Bank.* They wanted control over water

Israel would collect Value Added Tax (VAT) and import duties on goods destined for the Palestinian territories, which they do and are supposed to transfer the funds to PLO but there have been instances when they didn't. Any divergence from Israeli trade policy, particularly tariffs, required Israeli approval.

&gt;Taba Talks (2001):

Israel proposed annexing blocks of settlements in the West Bank.

Israel firmly opposed the right of return for Palestinian

&gt;Road Map for Peace (2002-2003):

Israel's acceptance of a *provisional* Palestinian state was conditional on Palestine's complete disarmament and giving up any right to an army or armed forces. Again.

Israel formally accepted the Road Map but later attached 14 reservations in which they said for example they wouldn't accept stipulations that would limit *""natural growth""* within existing settlements. So basically they will continue with the settlements, which they call "" natural growth"" also said that it should not include any hint of a right of return for Palestinian refugees to Israel.

Israel also wanted to retain control over Palestinian airspace and electromagnetic (broadcasting) fields, asked to be no mention of the 1967 borders or any other borders which PLO wanted as a starting point, asked for military control in Jordan Valley.",1

So no, pre-1948, Arabs living in Palestine did not identify as significantly different than those from Syria or Jordan. These lines were drawn in the sand post WW1, and didn't reflect any nationalist identities of the people living there.

Palestinians formally started the war perhaps, but again it was in response to a loss of land. The land that made up the current state of Israel far exceeded that which was owned by Jewish individuals at the time. Jewish people at the time did not peacefully accept the decision, there was anti Palestinian violence on there behalf which can't be put down to responding to Palestinian aggression. And in any case, the Jewish people were just new migrants, the idea that they ought to have a state because some of them moved there (and I should point out the numbers were far lower than the Palestinians) is a jump and can't be compared to any other country's founding. 

Yes, if land and property was stolen it ought to be paid back. It was quite literally stolen after.

You can carry-on and on about your criticisms of Hamas. That's fine. They're legitimate criticisms. However, this legitimacy ends when you project them onto all Palestinians. 

To say again: 

**Hamas does not represent palestinians. collective punishment/retaliation on a civilian population, for real or perceived grievances against a specific organisation, is a war crime -- by definition.** 

There is no discussion. This has been clearly outlined by the UN, Geneva and Hague Conventions. If you endorse the collective blame, punishment and retaliation on ordinary Palestinians because of the crimes of Hamas, you are endorsing literal war crimes.",1
k702ib6,"Thanks for the response.

First of all. I have to say that I'm pro-Israel. This is a selfish opinion from the perspective of a goy living in a goyim nation where a lot of diaspora Jews reside.

I've expressed by perspective in detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17hsb6b/a\_goyim\_perspective\_ideally\_we\_should\_defend\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17hsb6b/a_goyim_perspective_ideally_we_should_defend_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Basically, my observation is that a lot of diaspora Jews are very uncivilized. I'm defining civilized as somebody who can harmoniously assimilate into a nation and care about all the people within the nation, especially the various workers in the nation whose labor is utilized for daily life.

I don't think it's the diaspora Jew's fault that he is uncivilized. It is not a feature that is an intrinsic characteristic, but it is a feature that is forced upon the Jew because of his history. The diaspora Jew is very anxious of non-Jews in their host nation. He had to be this way for self preservation as an identity throughout time.

The anti-Semite is upset that the diaspora Jew cannot assimilate and become like a brother in a national brotherhood. This anti-Semitism further cloisters the Jew in his isolated Jewish identity. It reinforces that Jewish identity. This cloistering also has a reciprocal effect on the anti-Semite. They both become skeptical of one another, and this skepticism grows.

I think it's a terrible plight, what the Jews had to endure. However, a hopeful future is one in which the diaspora Jew calms his nerves and assimilates like other civilized people. Meanwhile, a Jewish identity is carried forward though the national identity of Israel. This is an outcome that the goyim want, and I think this is an outcome that the diaspora Jew can also come to want once he understands the benefits of letting one's guard down and having a common brotherhood with the fellow citizen.

You may disagree with that analysis. But, based on my observation, if a nation is in a state of peace for a long time, it has a civilizing influence on the citizenry and there is an element of cohesion and peace than can occur.

And, as stable nations remain in peace with one another and trade with one another, not just goods, but also ideas and stories, and as the citizens themselves travel and taste different nations, there may be encountered gradual global sensibilities.

\---

On the subject of the theft of land.

1&gt; First of all, it ought to be recognized that private property of any individual or collective identity is largely maintained through narrative. Land in the beginning belongs to nobody. It is a feature of nature.

2&gt; Secondly, a newborn is born without any conception of what is its property and what is not its property. It is given the conception of the property nature of things via its own action in the world and also via narrative transfer from the prior generations.

3&gt; Third of all, different individual and collective identities may hold in their imagination and memory different narratives and different conceptions of what is or is not its private property, or what is owed to it or not owed to it.

The conflict over belongingness is not necessarily a feature can can be inspected objectively. A historical analysis will never yield the truth of the matter because the truth resides in the subjective memories of competing identities who have their own conception or narrative about the truth.

That's my pov. And I think it's an accurate pov that people fail to grapple with.",1

And since the 30s the Brits did a lot to sabotage this project, and they did because they gave in to Palestinian violence by the way. 

Speaking of Palestinian violence, this is very well documented, you can enter Wikipedia and see the aggressive side on this conflict were the Arabs. They weren't willing to accept any compromise whatsoever, and decided this entire piece of land belongs to them (which wasn't true legally and morally), but their solution was to kill all the Jews.

They attacked Israel in 47 in response to the UN deciding to divide the land into two countries. Not negotiation, not peace, just violence. Israel did what it had to to defend itself.

Mainstream media rarely reports Israel's crimes and their terrorist settlers' crimes in the West Bank, but these Arabic media reports every single thing that happens, whether it’s in favor of Palestine or not.

The hashtags “#PrayForGaza”, “#GazaUnderAttack” were restricted or marked as sensitive posts on Twitter but when Israeli officials post videos of them bombarding Gaza with false titles and descriptions, that’s not restricted. And so on.

These are just simple examples of why Arabic media is more unbiased than Western outlets. Of course they have their biases, like Al Jazeera never reporting about Hamas' crimes against civilians until they are debunked (like the 40 babies lie, they never reported it until it was proven a lie).

Again, I'm not saying Arabic media is not biased, they are just more unbiased than other medias. And in the topics I sent, these are facts and not just them reporting one point of view, they reported what the Israelis said, or posted videos of the events and not just words like most Western media reports: “I think I've just seen beheaded babies”.

I consider myself pretty acquainted with the situation from the 30s until today, and I have taken both sides before, and followed both medias and can spot when a media outlet is being biased and blind or unbiased and transparent (in this topic I mean, I'm not a detective in everything).

But still, I’m not sure what part of the sources I sent seem suspicious? They reported literally what the Israeli officials said, and they shared videos published by Hezbollah themselves, there are bo touches added.

&gt;There are such thing as Palestinian Jews

Palestine was never a country. A Palestinian Jew will just mean a Jew that was born within the region of Palestine. Like myself.

&gt;who have been openly vocal against Zionism for decades.

95% of the Jews in the world are Zionists. There's a small minority such as the Neturi Karta who are antizionists, who work with Iran against Jews, who deny the Holocaust, etc... and they've been banned by every other Jewish group, including the Satmar Jews, who are also ""Anti-Zionist"". But not nearly as extreme as them.

&gt;Because they don’t have to worry about Muslim anti semitism. They are semites too and recognize Jews as people of the book who have protected rights in Islam since many prophets in the quran are Israelites.

Right. They were treated perfectly fine by Muslims, like being second class citizen, subject to different laws, subject to humiliating laws, often subject to pogroms and hatred. Being cannon fodder in wars even. 

You're right that we were treated significantly better in the Muslim world then in Europe. But the idea that we were completely safe there is ridiculous.

Also, antisemitism is hatred against Jews, not all semites. Jew-hatred was just a bit too on the nose. Arabs can very much be Antisemitic. 

&gt;Why should they divide their land in half for colonizers

Wasn't their land, they owned parts of it, but so did the Jews.

&gt;Why should people have to move and make way for them?

They didn't. It was the Arabs' declaration of war and refusal for peace that caused the Nakba.

&gt;Is it the Palestinians fault your not safe in anti Semitic Europe

No it is not. I mean, now it is as seen in the media, many of the Pro-Palestinians attack random Jews because of Israel.

&gt;When Palestinians were consistently, institutionally and legally discriminated against in Lebanon (1948 to today), no one marched in the streets of London.

Plenty of the Palestinians in question joined in on a literal civil war partially as a result of things like this so if you have a point about Palestinians or people in general only caring about Palestinians when it involves Jews I'd suggest you scrap it considering the history of Palestinians having no problem revolting against the wishes of Arab governments that treated them questionably.   


Palestinians didn't exclusively fight against Israel although Palestinians were still more concerned with protesting the root cause of their suffering (Israel) as opposed to the country they've been made refugees to mistreating them who they considered their brethren ([case in point](https://www.reportdigital.co.uk/reportage-photo-protest-against-the-israeli-invasion-of-lebanon-london-1982-06-aug-image00119368.html)) no matter what. Palestinians have historically had far larger problems to protest against but I'm sure theres been some protests regarding this issue in Lebanon. I know my dad went out to pro-Palestinian protests in NYC when the Lebanese civil war was ongoing although I'm not sure if it was specifically related to the civil war or even Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. If your point is about people not caring about Palestinians in Lebanon then thats baloney because people and organizations do [https://nakba.amnesty.org/en/chapters/lebanon/](https://nakba.amnesty.org/en/chapters/lebanon/).

&gt;When (in September 1970) Jordan fought with the PLO and killed 3,400 Palestinians, no one marched in the streets of London.

Jordan mainly killed militants, and here Palestinians were actually engaged in warfare as opposed to protesting although that also happened in Jordan, after it was over the PLO and Jordan reconciled. As a matter of fact three of the four prime ministers of Jordan that were in office during the war were of Palestinian origin. Palestinians were far more likely to protest against the country that had been systemically displacing, oppressing and killing them for decades (Israel) as opposed to protesting a government in large part made up of people of Palestinian origin which they had squabbles with. Same situation with the Hamas-Fatah conflict, what was there to protest about? They were essentially the same people involved in infighting. Whatever senseless killing there was in Jordan, Lebanon and the Gaza strip (between Hamas and Fatah) is unfortunate but irrelevant in the big picture when the main issue was Israel.   


Also Gazans did protest against Hamas [https://www.timesofisrael.com/protests-against-hamas-reemerge-in-the-streets-of-gaza-but-will-they-persist/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/protests-against-hamas-reemerge-in-the-streets-of-gaza-but-will-they-persist/).

The focus on Israel was because generally speaking Palestinians didn't really harbor any hatred for Lebanese people, whatever issues Palestinians had that were exacerbated by the Lebanese government were nowhere as severe and systemic as that of Israel's policies towards Palestinians in their own homeland. Yes there was fighting against certain Lebanese militias and whatnot in Lebanon, no Palestinians don't only start to rebel or protest against policies negatively affecting them when it involved Jews, yes the bigger issue at hand was Israel and yes thats why protests in the west were mainly directed against it. 

&gt;When ISIS (2015) and later the Syrian government (2018) fought Palestinians in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, killed many people there and ethnically cleansed 18,000 Palestinians by removing them from the camp, no one marched in the streets of London.

This is just silly

People and countries did far more serious things than protesting in response to ISIS' actions.

&gt;When Hamas slaughtered in Gaza 100s of PLO supporters in the Fatah–Hamas conflict (2007), and set up a brutal Islamist regime that persecuted gays, silenced all opposition and unleashed awful violence against Israel (2001 to 2023), no one marched in the streets of London.

Pro-Israelis certainly protested.  


So far we've established you didn't bother researching your own claims at all and you've used false equivalencies between Arab infighting, not comparable to that of Israel's systemic actions, lies about people not caring in regards to say Afghanistan and Syria all making you fail to show Palestinians or pro-Palestinians as hypocrites.

What I'm more curious about is; are you actually concerned with some imagined lack of opposition to these conflicts or are you just trying to discredit pro-Palestinian protests? Are you of the opinion that these other conflicts - if they weren't spoken about, despite the fact that they were - should have also been spoken about alongside Palestine or do you not want any pro-Palestine protests at all and are mainly interested in reserving protests for other conflicts you thought were more deserving that don't involve Israel?",0

But in general I would respond that a) the scale of the two situations is difficult to compare, this was minority populations from a large number of countries versus around half the population of one country. This isn't to say one is worse or better but that comparison are difficult. B) Mizrahi Jewish people in Israel are known for being especially anti-Palestinian and committing acts of violence against them (settler violence as an example). Could we not say a Mizrahi Jewish person in the IDF not be committing their violence in part because of these family memories? And finally, those Jewish people currently live lives as citizens in a country. The Palestinians live under an occupation where they live under military rule (unlike settlers living in the same areas - hence why apartheid is a fair term) with considerably worse conditions for living (i.e. lack of water, threats of violence), no real passports etc. Again, not comparable situations",1

"" Do you think you will be admitted into Paradise without being tested like those before you? They were afflicted with suffering and adversity and were so ˹violently˺ shaken that ˹even˺ the Messenger and the believers with him cried out, “When will Allah’s help come?” Indeed, Allah’s help is ˹always˺ near. "" (Al-Baqarah verse 214)

""When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.” "" (Al-Baqarah verse 249)

"" When they advanced to face Goliath and his warriors, they prayed, “Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, make our steps firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.” "" (Al-Baqarah verse 250)

"" So they defeated them by Allah’s Will, and David killed Goliath. And Allah blessed David with kingship and wisdom and taught him what He willed. Had Allah not repelled a group of people by ˹the might of˺ another, corruption would have dominated the earth, but Allah is Gracious to all. "" (Al-Baqarah verse 251)

"" Most certainly, if you ˹believers˺ are firm and mindful ˹of Allah˺ and the enemy launches a sudden attack on you, Allah will reinforce you with five thousand angels designated ˹for battle˺. "" (Ali 'Imran verse 125)

k6zzx1x,"Actually, you can’t pick a side here. This is a conflict that’s been going for decades. The most recent conflict between Hamas and Israel is a copy cat of what happened in the past few years and I will give you two examples: 

Operation 'Cast Lead'** (2008-2009): estimated 1391 Palestinians killed, 759 to be civillians, 344 children, 110 women. 13 Israelis killed, out of which 10 are soldiers. Israel also admits using 'White Phosphorus' during their military offensive

Similar shit happened in 2014 and it was named “Operation protective edge” After the Kidnapping &amp; Murder of 3 Israeli Teens allegedly by Hamas (Opinions divided among Israel's Security Services on who was actually behind it), Disproportionate Collective Punishment ensued against the people of Gaza (estimated 2104 Palestinians killed, including 1,462 civilians, of whom 495 were children and 253 women. 17,200 homes destroyed or severely damaged. More than 10,000 injured) 

The whole thing is a “Wash-Rinse-Repeat” cycle in which Hamas the extremist terrorist group funded by Israel and Qatar attacks incompetently causing casualties in the occupied territories; Israel welcomes the attack and retaliates with triple to four times more damage to the Gaza civilians who are already living in a prison in the most dire conditions in one of the most densely populated area in the whole world.  
Bibu and his bloody evil Zionist regime strive on the existence of Hamas to justify their annexation agenda and their brutality and atrocities.

k6zz2gi,"Jesus Christ this video is full of misinformation. Doesn’t even go a full minute before saying something incorrect. 

1) The conflict predates 1947. The first wave of Zionist settlers came in the 1890’s fleeing Pogroms in Russia when the land was Ottoman. There was conflict with Arabs but it resembled more mafia style grudges, more personal not ethnic. Around 1920 is when the conflict became crystallized in Muslim vs Jew. In 1928 there was Jewish-Muslim riots where the Arabs purged the Jews in Hebron who had lived there for several millennia. In turn there were also Jewish reprisals. The violence only got worse in the 30’s, culminating in the Palestinian uprising in 1936-39’, to defend themselves Israelis formed the Irgun and Haganah. During WWII the leader of the uprising and other Arab nationalist leaders fled to Germany. They became even more antisemitic, especially as the Germans agitated antisemitic feelings through Radio Berlin. You can still see some of these hateful ramblings repeated to this day, some of it ended up in the Hamas founding charter. This was the state of affairs in 1947, an intensifying mutual hatred.

2) Jews Christians and Muslims didn’t “live in peace” until Israelis showed up. You can find many cases of anti Christian and anti Jewish violence throughout the millennia of Islamic domination. I don’t think if Israel established Sharia law except with Jews and Muslims switching places that anyone would be okay with it.

3) In 1948 there was a plan for a partition, but other than that everything he says is incorrect. First he uses the wrong map, that is the 1967 borders used for a 2SS, the original plan had a bigger Arab state than that. Second he says that the British did it, they did not.  The British were partially in support of Zionism in the 20’s when they allowed in many Jews who were fleeing the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe, but as the conflict became a headache for them they turned against it in the 30’s. They also allowed Arabs to migrate into Palestine as well. They banned further Jewish immigration in the late 30’s. Furthermore they had the Peel Commission which would’ve have a tiny Jewish state at best. The Zionists turned against Britain and there was a three way conflict between the Arabs, Jews and British. During WWII, the Allies agreed to put all League of Nations Mandates under UN control, and Palestine was one of them. It was the UN who crafted the partition plan, not the UK. Their conclusion was that despite the communities being interconnected, there was so much bad blood that they couldn’t be in the same state and they created that partition plan. 

Now, despite what the guy says, the UK was not happy with Israel, from the 30’s until 50’s the UK and Zionists were in conflict. The UK abstained from the vote on the partition plan, and mostly sided with the Arabs. Their view was that Egypt, Jordan and Iraq were going to be their allies, and they were more critical for maintaining its colonial empire. The UK citizens hated Israel for how its militias assassinated British soldiers. There is actually an episode in this era where the French, Israelis and Syrians foil an attempted coup in Syria by the Iraqis and British. 

That changed with the rise of Arab nationalism. The Pro UK monarchies in Iraq and Egypt were overthrown by anti Western nationalists, and with the Suez Canal under threat the UK began to align with Israel. 

The USSR was similar to Britain but in the opposite way. They recognized Israel ASAP and they allowed the Czechs to export arms to rearm the Zionist militia. However when Israel didn’t turn out as Socialist as they liked and the pro Western monarchs were overthrown, the Soviets turned pro Arab.

I haven’t mentioned the US yet and that’s because they didn’t play a big role early on. They didn’t have any troops in the region like the UK did and they didn’t arm anyone like the USSR did. That only changed later on in the 60’s with the Six Day War, for similar reasons to the UK I.e. aligning interests. Now they were also one of the first to recognize Israel, but that was more due to widespread sympathy within America. Zionists raised funds through sympathizers which was at an all time high due to WWII. The State Department internally didn’t want to get involved, but felt compelled due to public outcry. 

After that he seems to completely gloss over like 90% of the history. The Palestinian Liberation Organization is never mentioned, the Oslo Accords are mentioned once, Hamas is mentioned once, moreover he incorrectly says the chain of events being “Israel blockades Gaza -&gt; Hamas is elected” when it’s “Israel leaves Gaza -&gt; PA holds elections where Hamas wins plurality-&gt; Hamas attacks the PLO in Gaza and takes over -&gt; Hamas attacks Israel -&gt; Israeli-Egyptian Blockade starts”. 

Purposefully leaving out genocidal threats from the Arabs, any mention of a peace process, etc., is dishonest to say the least. You cannot get a clear understanding when you don’t even attempt to portray the conflict from an Israeli view.",0

k6zyu6r,"1- it was legally acquired. I did mention that, Jews bought these lands from Arabs (who didn't really understand the grand plan , they thought it was a normal deal) 

2- the 1st option was 1936 peel proposal and it was rejected by the zinoist leadership btw (they only accepted the idea that they will get state but refused that partition). 

Arabs refused because they said that it was a betrayl to the promises they got from the British to govern palestine (after they helped Britain in taking down the ottoman) + the fact that the arabs owened 94% of the land and were at least 4 times the number of Jews. 


The arabs in 1936 called for an independent state of Palestine, ""with protection of all legitimate Jewish and other minority rights and safeguarding of reasonable British interests"".


BTW, israel wanted the whole area. Not a divided paleatine ... According to Benny Morris,  Ben gurion and Weizmanm they were thinking of accepting the 1936 plan and saw it ""as a stepping stone to some further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine""... in fact even 1947 was seen to be accepted and then to be expanded.",1

Hamas doesn't give us any options besides disarming it and dismantling its control in Gaza. It has a cost because it operates from populated areas and uses the population as human shields. Until recently, we had the Iron Dome to keep our people safe; now, this is not enough.

I as an arab also get daily racism projected towards me. From morning news to walking in the shop being followed by security. But i can keep two thoughts in my head. I can accept that there is racism against arabs and that there is against jewish people as well.

I have never read about soviet/russian or anti jewish propaganda from the Ford family, but will try to read upon it tonight. I can not discuss that point, if you have please link info.

Regarding apartheid.
I have relatives in Israel, arab AND israeli relatives. I understand you can not believe whatever you read on reddit, but since i have seen it irl then i know it exist. My arab relatives can not build buildings with concrete, all builded structures needs to be able to dis-assemble and relocated. They also can not build on new land wether it is theirs or if it belongs/stolen** by israel. They can not build upwards either. This is the reason (if you have been to Israel) that arabic neighborhood look clustered and their buildings are in chaos. I have been to Israel 20+ times and experienced this myself. My Israeli relatives on the other hand get free education, public trnasportation card, no issues traveling, no issues renting ex. cars etc.

The NAKBA means the catastrophe in arabic. The NAKBA is reffering to when palestinians (only arabic palestinians) where forced to relocate and/or killed. One of MANY examples is the whole village of Tantura where the IDF rounded up the Palestinians and executed them. This is documented and ex IDF soldiers has confessed. All ages, child to elderly, rounded up in cages and executed because they wanted to settle the village with jewish people.

Regarding Palestine historically:
Palestine was part and self governed under the Ottoman empire from late 1400-1914. Just as states in the US and districts/counties are self-governed. 1914 the brittish ockupied/annected Palestine and decided with zionist imperialists to take the opportunity and decide for a two-state solution.

Who would accept this deal? I wouldnt. And if it was the other way around, meaning if Israel was self-governed under Ottoman i would demonstrate against Palestine and the west for stealing the land and bluntly deciding on a two-state solution.

So in my opinion there was a state there before Israel and the people of this state can not be forced to relocate or killed. If you dont agree to this then:
There was a people living there before and they can not be forced to be relocated or killed.

And if they are relocated against their will WHY MAKE IT into Ghettos?


Lastly, 
Look at Ukraine used as a pawn in the imperial war between the superpowers west/east.
The US dont care about the Ukranians. The Russians dont care about the Ukranians even if they almost are blood brothers. It is all teritorial dispute.

When it comes to middle-east it is the same. When the US is done with resource and teritorial extraction they will not aid Israel anymore. They will leave just as they left Afghanistan, iraq, Ukraine etc. And we are the ones that will suffer.
The arabs and the jews. I believe the jewish people need to realise this and wake up from a zionist rule, and together with the arabs re-build what Palestine/israel once was.

The reason why the pro-palestinian posts on this sub get downvoted and ridiculed is because the arguments are full of logical fallacies, false information, and appeal to emotion. This is a sub for debate, not propaganda. If you want your argument to hold water you better make sure it’s waterproof.

At the core of the pro-palestine argument is hatred and rage against Jewish Israelis for being the victors of the wars (against all odds) following the creation of the state of Israel and the displacement of the people (mostly Arabs) who chose violence over Israeli citizenship. Many first and second generation refugees are still angry that their ancestors were unable to successfully defend their land and were also unable to fight for it back. Their anger has fomented into hatred and rage has blinded the pro Palestinains from seeing and accepting reality. 

Are the Palestinains angry? Yes. Is Israel to blame? No. Is there apartheid or genocide or colonialism happening in Israel? No no and no. 

Conflict is the absence of dialouge. Israel has no dialouge with Hamas because they are blinded by rage and their positions are illogical. 

On the same token, there can be no progressive discussion until the pro-palestinians remove their antisemetic goggles and see the conflict for what it really is; a complex geopolitical situation involving the world’s major religions and highly invested political powers in the world’s most contested peice of real estate.

And even then, no kne will dictate to another nation''s army of to defend itself, thus Israel is making ground moves, contradicting your statement. ""

The world has collectively agreed that war crimes are illegal. Nothing about it is defense. We are not telling you ""how to win a war"" we are telling you to stop breaking international law. You don't like it? Then leave the UN and get ready for boycotts and sanctions. We don't have to support a country committing war crimes. The absolute entitlement in your statement speaks for itself. Every nation is held to certain standards Israel is not exempt. You can cry about it all you want but I don't have to do business with a country I don't agree with. Which is why Israel fears a boycott movement which is already starting to happen. 

The best thing Israel could do in this situation is stop bombing Gaza and open up negotiations. From the looks of it the IDF doesn't have a chance at taking on Hamas in ground combat. Every time IDF attempts to send troops into Gaza they are instantly forced to retreat. If you can't win a war the best thing to do is negotiate.

Open the link and read. Jews and Palestinians are genitically related weather you like it or not. Israel wouldn't talk about Palestinians like animals if their intentions were to fught Hamas. You're also ignoring 75 years of genocide commited by the Israeli government and focusing on one attack from Hamas' side. Let's also make sure to not ignore the fact that Israel has killed 7000 Palestinians in the past week. If you aren't aware of what's happening let me explain it to you. Israel wan't to widen it's territory and is currently doing that by what it has always done, terrorizing civilians until they're forced to leave so that Israel can own more and more parts of Gaza. Half the population in Gaza are children, they didn't vote for Hamas nor did they refuse a two state solution. Hamas was founded in the 80s by the Israeli government to control Gazan civilians. They didn't ""vote"" nor ""choose"" Hamas, it wasn't a choice, they had no say in it. Gaza doesn't have a government, Gaza doesn't have laws. It's citizen's can't even rest by fear of being bombed. A two state solution would be a good deal if Netanyahu is taken down and if and only Palestinians are granted the same rights as Israelis, which means being able to travel in and out of Gaza, being able to live in Israel and having laws against discrimination. If you refuse to have Palestinian go back to their homes and treat them like human beings, then what you're doing is not in name of peace. It's colonialism. Everyone can live together just like they lived for thousands of years. There should be a Ceasefire and evacuation of ALL Palestinian civilians, only then can you fight Hamas.",0

Antisemitism is poison. In all of its forms. If being critical of Bibi's Israel is antisemitism, turns out I know a ton of antisemitic Jews of all stripes. Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiments are equally poisonous. We only have a chance at peace when we see the Other and realize they laugh and cry just like us.

k6zv6rd,"&gt; because they never wanted to consider a serious 2ss at all regardless of how willing Palestinians were. 

I don't think the Palestinians were all that serious either.  One of the reasons I never considered the 2SS all that viable.  Any 2SS would either be horribly opposed by one side or majority opposed by both. 

&gt; opposed to the belief on the side of the Israeli right that Israel and only Israel has a right to the entire region

The Israeli right doesn't talk in terms of ""right to the entire region"" in the sense the left does. Right in their context means which one can form a viable state.  Palestinians in the refugee camps never tried.  Palestinians in the West Bank, did try for a few years but let Hamas and the 2nd Intifada undermine it.  And even then didn't do a great job.  Palestinians in Gaza never tried.   Whatever else you say about the Yishuv under tremendous adversity they tried and succeeded. The right looks at Palestinians and figures they don't really want a state. 

&gt;  ignoring the political issues won't make them go away.

I think it will.  What happened to Normans, Aquitaines and Burgunians?  Remove the systematic supports for Palestinian nationalism and Palestinian becomes an ethnic not a national identity.  Go further and it becomes part of the ethnic background of Israelis, a historical features.

&gt;  I don't think Israel wants a strong, sustainable Palestinian middle class, since that same middle class will immediately demand political rights.

You mean like what is happening with Israeli-Arabs as they are entering the middle class.  To be middle class generally requires a lot of  assimilation.  A society can tilt the field so that is even more true.  An assimilated middle class demanding rights doesn't endanger the system it strengthens it.  When the Irish demanded rights or later when blacks did it made American more in line with its ideals not less.  When a Zionist ethnically Palestinian middle class demands rights it makes Israel more not less Zionist. 

&gt;  I remember reading somewhere that the newfound economic status many Palestinians would find themselves in as a result of this hypothetical policy succeeding could serve as a carrot in a carrot and stick approach towards Palestinians for them to ignore political rights,

Yes that's probably how it starts, generally how it starts. 

&gt; The political and economic issues are fundamentally tied, I believe that was the position labor had which I agree with.

Of course.  That's where the populism is getting in the way.  Mizrahi Jews would be unquestionably somewhat undermined by this approach.  Though as time passes it is less threatening to them and potentially more threatening to Haredi Jews. 

&gt; Sort of like how Mizrahi jews and ashkenazi Jews aren't 'neighbors' in Israel, even though you might say Tel Aviv-ians neighbor Holonians.

They were friendly neighbors in the 1950s and 60s.  Then they started mixing for 2 generations and everyone is just Israeli.  Mizrahi and Ashkenazi, especially among the non-Haredi population are ceasing to exist as distinct populations. 

&gt; It is the right who moreso make the nationality in Israel be determined by race.

We disagree.  I think you are dead wrong on this.  Read some of the classic right.

&gt; As for the Iron wall there's an unmistakable degree of racial supremacy present there.

Don't see it.  If anything he is arguing the opposite.  *The enemy aren't idiots.  They aren't going to sell out their interests cheaply or easily...*

k6zux5f,"THE DISGRACE OF THE US CARRIER BATTLE GROUPS

Shortly after the beginning of Israel's intensified assaults on Palestinian civilians, the USA announced that they will be sending a carrier battle group to the region. I thought that, perhaps, the USA would tamp down Israel's evil attacks and start the process of helping the Palestinians in the open-air prison. The carrier ships carry an air arsenal that has the capacity to airlift MREs and supplies to troops in the battlefield many times over. I thought that when these American navy ships arrived, that they would immediately start sending humanitarian supplies for the suffering Palestinians, and keep the insane Israelis in check.

On the contrary, not only did they not send nor offer to send any humanitarian relief, come to find out that their whole purpose is to enable and support Israel in their continued human rights crimes against occupied Palestine. That if anyone dare get in that criminal government's way, they would be subject to attack by the United States military.

They're not even pretending to be an ""arsenal of democracy"" any more. Americans were supposed to be the most generous people in the world.

— An anonymous redditor in his bedroom living in utter peace and well nurtured. 
Seriously what the hell happened to humanity. This is a vivid example of the American wack agenda of let’s pick a side game. 
The terrorist organization you’re talking about is fed and nurtured by Israel. Israel helped in funding and creating Hamas to counter the PLO the secular resistance group. If you read and dig down in history, you will have known that America and Israel’s main concern is the rise of secularism in the middle east. 
I will simplify things to you because 90% of this subreddit is pro-Zionist dumb individuals. 
You know that “Hatred breeds hatred” right ? 
Extremism also breeds extremism; in other words: you can’t be extremist if there’s nothing that justifies and fuels your extremism. And this is how the USA created “ Al Qaeda” or “ Al mujaheedin” and this how they created “ ISIS” and so did Iran with “Hezbollah”. The same case applies to Hamas that emerged as a paramilitary group after the first Intifada in 1987. The Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas, took full control of Gaza in 2007, ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces in days of bloody fighting, a year after Hamas won the Palestinians' last parliamentary election. 
Following its takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a tight blockade against the militants which has squeezed the Palestinian territory. Since their takeover, many protests took the streets in Gaza as many people were opposing Hamas which is something I am sure you never heard of 🤡 and also since their takeover, the conflict took a major turnaround in which Hamas the extremist terrorist group funded by Qatar and Israel attacks incompetently causing casualties in the occupied territories; Israel welcomes the attack and retaliates with triple to four times more damage to the Gaza civilians who are already living in a prison in the most dire conditions in one of the most densely populated area in the whole world. 
Bibu and his Zionist regime strive on the existence of Hamas to justify their annexation agenda and their brutality and atrocities. 
This is one of many sources regarding the creation and the funding of Hamas :

I found this [ICRC summary](https://international-review.icrc.org/articles/applying-principle-of-proportionality-to-sieges-914) very clear. The tdlr: 
* siege is legal, provided it is intended to secure a military objective
* it's unclear whether humanitarian aid has to be permitted in &amp; when
* the prevailing interpretation of IHL holds starving the besieged civilian population to be incidental to the military objective which a (legal) siege must have; this means that the principle of proportionality does not apply
* the ICRC is unhappy about this, and proposes a more restrictive alternative explanation, but that wasn't the prevailing law in 2021, and the law doesn't seem to have changed

k6zsmsg,"The Jewish people definitely revolted against Roman rule, and Romans had a responsibility to suppress the rebellion and save Roman lives. The Romans could’ve handled it all better and so could the Jewish people. It ended brutally but not surprisingly. 

With that in mind, I agree with you that OP’s point about Israel being “stolen” from the Jewish people 2,000 years ago is not too compelling or relevant to the Jewish people’s right to establishing modern day Israel. 

That said - if I’m understanding your intent in asking the second question… the Jewish people were upset about being “made into a diaspora” because they were relegated to 2,000 years of persecution. The solution to ending persecution against Jewish people is by allowing them to have a specifically Jewish country not under the control of Rome, Ottoman Empire, British Empire… and so on. The Jewish people needed a country where they didn’t need to fear their own government will mistreat or scapegoat them because they will be seen as the “other” or they “don’t belong here” - which is what happened a countless number of times.

To take this a step further and include *why* this Jewish country is in modern Israel… their right to the land of Israel in particular has more to do with the Jewish people who lived there over thousands of years and the Jewish people who immigrated there from the 1800s until 1947. The region was under Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and then British rule… and was never it’s own state since pre-modern history Israel. That said, there were many Arabs also living there during these times as well, and those Arabs needed their own land as well. With all these factors combined, it was a region that was perfect for the creation of an Arab state *and* a Jewish state when the need arose in 1947. It was decolonized by the British Empire, and redistributed to two counties that would exist side by side in peace and perpetuity… at least, that was the hope until war was declared against Israel by the Arab nations and the dominoes fell and kept falling until **BAM** - we are where we are today.",1

To the French - majority of the land under international administration (which breaks promises to Arabs and Jews) and the rest of the land to the colonial powers (breaks the previous 2 promises) and also there was a catch - nothing shall be done to the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish population, which breaks the declaration for the whole 3 parties.

Israël and Jews are two different things!

Israel/Zionist of today use the name Israel and the Jewish religion as facade…

This isn’t about religion, never was and never will be…

I advice you to read the scriptures in their original language: Aramaic/hebrew/greek and see for yourself…

Who guided them to take the land ""back"" a prophet ? No…

They did this of their own belief and for their interest against God words!
They use the scriptures when it suit them and leave them on the side when it shouldn’t or change/alter them as they change clothes…

God promise them the land IF they followed Prophet muses and his brother Aaron! But only a small fraction did and the other became of the disbelievers…

Pharaoh had everything,(armies, money…) was arrogant, of the transgressor, a disbeliever who went as far as wanting to kill prophets of the lord …

No long after he was eliminated him and everything/everyone that followed him, swallowed by the sea only for the pyramids left and his body as a proof/warning…

That’s what happen when god is on your side.

Now take Palestine, if god was on the Israelites side, why didn’t in 75 years, they didn’t manage to take their ""land"" back ?

Look at what they have:

Money/funding 

Weapons/armies 

And so on…

And yet nothing 

If this doesn’t remind you of pharaoh 🤷‍♂️

What do you think will happen? What happened to pharaoh?

Exactly, and that’s why netannyu is in complet despair, because he know the end story, he know… 



And in the 1880’s, their project of taking the land back was revive…

With the help of British and who’s not they after the war slowly but surely have been traveling to Palestine…

And around 1948, it became a hostile takeover!

Keep in mind that for CENTURIES, Jewish, Muslim and Christians have been living at peace with each their own beliefs…

Then the UN ""intervention""and the rest is history…

It’s just a little summary of what happened…

Do research yourself and see for yourself the truth

The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).

&gt;In a second post, Abd Elhadi shared an image of Hamas forces breaching Israel’s security border, with a caption reading “Let’s go, Berlin style,” in an apparent reference to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The indictment also accused Abd Elhadi of celebrating the October 7 attack in a WhatsApp group with four of her friends. **“Girls, have you heard the good news?” she allegedly messaged**, going on to celebrate the attack on the south of Israel, along with the kidnapping of IDF soldiers and “possibly also civilians.”",1

- In 1941, during an event known as the [Farhud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhud), Baghdad witnessed a violent pogrom where 175 Jews were killed, 1,000 were injured, and 900 homes were destroyed.
  
- Between 1950-1951, the Iraqi government passed an [emergency bill](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01151.x) allowing Jews to renounce their citizenship and leave. However, this same law stripped citizenship from those migrating to Israel. This made it difficult for Jews, especially those who went to Israel, to [return or regain their citizenship](https://www.jns.org/iraqi-officials-restoration-of-citizenship-does-not-extend-to-iraqi-jews/).

- The Iraqi Hashemite monarchy and the subsequent Baath party rule witnessed the implementation of laws that led to the [confiscation of Jewish property](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/constitutional-challenge-iraqs-treatment-iraqi-jews). Notably, Law 5/1951 specifically addressed the asset management of Jews renouncing citizenship.

**Egypt:**

- After the [nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_Gamal_Abdel_Nasser#1956–1957) by President Nasser, approximately 25,000 Jews were expelled from Egypt and 1,000 were imprisoned. This wave of expulsion coincided with the broader exodus of foreigners during the Suez Crisis.

- The year 1948 marked a distressing period for Jews in Cairo. Following the declaration of the State of Israel, Jewish areas in Cairo underwent bombings from June to September, leading to [70 Jewish deaths and nearly 200 injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Cairo_bombings).

- The geopolitical tensions surrounding the 1956 Suez Crisis and the 1967 Six-Day War were defining moments for the Jewish community in Egypt. Many Jews were either [expelled](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/the-second-jewish-exodus-from-egypt-629167) or felt compelled to flee due to the hostile environment. On June 5, 1967, Egypt began [detaining Jewish men](https://www.jpost.com/magazine/on-the-eve-of-destruction-494236).

---

**Syria:**

- Following the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Syrian government imposed [travel restrictions on Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Syria#Independence_and_Civil_War), preventing them from leaving the country. These restrictions were upheld until 1961.


- The Six-Day War in 1967 prompted the Syrian government to introduce [further constraints](https://rpl.hds.harvard.edu/faq/judaism-syria) on its Jewish population, including prohibitions on Jewish travel and emigration.

---

**Yemen:**

- In 1922, Yemen's government reintroduced the [Orphans' Decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphans%27_Decree), an ancient Islamic law. This decree compelled the conversion to Islam of Jewish orphans under the age of 12.

- Between December 2–4, 1947, the Jewish community in the British Colony of Aden was subjected to a violent pogrom, known as the [Aden Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_anti-Jewish_riots_in_Aden). Triggered by the UN Partition vote, this incident resulted in the death of 82 Jews and substantial destruction and looting of their properties.

---

**Libya:**

- Between November 5-7, 1945, Tripoli witnessed a tumultuous episode, known as the [Tripoli Pogrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_Anti-Jewish_riots_in_Tripolitania). Rioting escalated not just in the city but also in surrounding towns, resulting in the deaths of over 140 Jews. Many others were injured, and countless Jewish properties were looted, destroyed, and damaged. This catastrophic event plunged numerous Jewish families into poverty and left them homeless.

- On July 21, 1970, the Libyan government enforced a directive that sanctioned [the confiscation of properties owned by Italians and Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Libya#Six-Day_War_and_its_aftermath). Particularly, this law impacted Jewish individuals who had previously fled Libya, especially post the 1967 Six-Day War. Their properties, now seized by the Libyan state, undermined the economic foundation of the Jewish community. The ramifications of these confiscations have persisted, with property disputes lingering into the post-Qaddafi era.",0

k6zpjde,"&gt;Thats what gets me. All these other nations and protests in our cities and countries for palestine. But are they going to help out at all? No. Let them cross the egypt border? No.

i will tell you why. it is by design. unfortunately for the palestinian people trapped there they are being forced into a humanitarian crisis to make a point. 

israel is cutting off supplies to try to make the point that hamas has stolen and stockpiled supplies but isn't sharing them with the people of palestine. they are hoping that the people of palestine will turn against hamas when they find out that hamas has been hoarding supplies. this was an unbelievably stupid strategy from israel. because:

hamas is pushing the people of gaza into a humanitarian crisis as well. they are doing this to make a point. they are very effectively showing the inhumane treatment palestinian citizens are receiving from israel. that doesn't mean they are willing to share their stockpiles because those are important supplies for when israel begins a ground invasion. mostly the attack was meant to provoke such a response from israel that it can be used to turn the world against israel.

additionally, hamas caused a situation where their allies in the region (hezbollah, iran etc) would feel compelled to step in. they are hoping this will escalate and pull actors like egypt jordan into the fight. 

egypt and jordan are also using the gazans to make a point. i believe they are hoping the humanitarian crisis in gaza will turn the world against israel without them having to step in and take an active position. 

everyone is using the palestinians in gaza and they are getting fucked. they are getting fucked by their own government. they are getting viscerally fucked by israel. they are getting fucked by everyone else who isn't stepping in to help.",1

If you are for Israel and for the innocent people who lives were lost due to Hamas, you SHOULD listen to people who want to advocate more diplomatic means that killing Palestinians in an indiscriminate way.  


Meanwhile the military industrial complex and possibly the oil industries are loving this war because this means profit for them.

k6zpgmn,"&gt;Israel should work with the United States and Qatar to negotiate with Hamas to reduce the greatest amount of bloodshed and come to a two state solution.

So the US and Qatar should negotiate with Hamas? The same Hamas whose charter read:

&gt;The Islamic Resistance Movement aspires to the realisation of Allah's promise, no matter how long that should take. The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said: ""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (evidently a certain kind of tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews."" (related by al-Bukhari and Moslem).

&gt;Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.

&gt;Knowing the parties constituting the conference, their past and present attitudes towards Moslem problems, the Islamic Resistance Movement does not consider these conferences capable of realising the demands, restoring the rights or doing justice to the oppressed. These conferences are only ways of setting the infidels in the land of the Moslems as arbitraters. When did the infidels do justice to the believers?

&gt;""But the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians, until thou follow their religion; say, The direction of Allah is the true direction. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, thou shalt find no patron or protector against Allah."" (The Cow - verse 120).

&gt;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.

Oh, sorry. I forgot that they [softened their wording a bit in 2017.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/hamas-words-and-deeds#:~:text=In%20its%20original%201988%20charter,%2C%20religious%20or%20sectarian%20grounds.%E2%80%9D) But their actions have shown no change, only escalation.

Intent to kill a person or group of people who happen to be of ethnic group A does not suffice, which is why it’s certainly possible for wars to occur without genocide.

Interesting to remember that the UN definition of genocide was the result of a looot of political compromise. For instance, the drafters considered adding mass displacement as one of the listed actions. It was ultimately excluded because many of the drafting countries knew they would be guilty of genocide if it was included. For the same reason, the drafters narrowed the definition to exclude the intentional destruction of groups based on their political beliefs.",0

k6zogqt,"What Arab governments ? 🙂🙂🙂

&gt; Israel is not alone in believing it must defeat Hamas. Over the past two weeks, **when I talked to Arab officials throughout the region whom I have long known, every single one told me that Hamas must be destroyed in Gaza**. They made clear that if Hamas is perceived as winning, it will validate the group’s ideology of rejection [resistance], give leverage and momentum to Iran and its collaborators and put their own governments on the defensive. But they said this in private. Their public postures have been quite different. Only a few Arab states openly condemned the Hamas massacre of more than 1,400 people in Israel. Why? Because Arab leaders understood that as Israel retaliated and Palestinian casualties and suffering grew, their own citizens would be outraged and they needed to be seen as standing up for the Palestinians, at least rhetorically. — ([Dennis Ross](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ross) - Oct. 27, 2023)

k6zod5y,"Exactly. So many people on both sides of the issue trying to frame it in a ‘you’re either with us or against us’ way and painting it as a 100% black and white issue.

Israel: Has a lot more individual and public freedoms, relatively pluralistic society, but has historically adopted heavy-handed tactics on an essentially captive Palestinian population. Whenever a conflict like this pops up, the death toll is always wildly lopsided, including and importantly in the number of civilians killed. The settlement building where the Israeli state protects religious fundamentalists as they tear down Palestinian neighbourhoods to build their own over the rubble, is abhorrent and only inflames this never-ending conflict. And given the much stricter treatment in Gaza seems to correlate with a heavier and more extreme militancy there, it’s reasonable to question whether there might be *some* causal link, ie would doing things differently possibly lead to less extremism in Gaza?

Palestine: Are legitimately oppressed, imagine trying to make a decent life there. They are literally between a rock and a hard place, the Israeli state and their own homegrown oppressors. Have suffered decades of commonplace violence and destruction and a crushing lack of any real opportunities. On the other hand, they are under the control of a terrorist government. Now we can argue the relevance of their own responsibility in that, the last real election was almost 2 decades ago and half of the population are minors and therefore weren’t even born yet, but there is clearly widespread support for Hamas and the wider ‘struggle’. And that ‘struggle’ being the unacceptable fact that there is a nation of Jewish people in the Middle East. And that is something that needs addressing too, the widespread hatred of Jewish people in the region. Some try to argue that the extremism of some Palestinians towards Israel is justified or explained by Israel’s oppression, but then what of the similar levels of animosity towards Israel in  Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and other Islamic nations who have even less contact or history with the state of Israel? They are not being oppressed by the Israeli state. So Israel is somewhat between a rock and a hard place as well, we can criticize their actions but it also seems like there isn’t anything they could do that would be accepted, Islamic nations don’t believe they should even exist at all.

Israel cannot just ignore what happened on October 7th, nor should anyone expect them to (notwithstanding those who clearly just approve of what happened, sadly there are many). But that doesn’t mean Israel is then justified in conducting wildly asymmetrical violence as collective punishment.

Nothing I’ve said here contradicts itself, but there are many on both sides pretending that it does.",0

We all know that the crimes of the Izrael occupation forces, in their cruelty and scale, exceeded any predictions and concerns. In my opinion, the situation in Gaza today is similar to the situation in Warsaw during World War II. But the attitude of its inhabitants is just as heroic, just as adamanting and pure. When, in order to terrorize Warsaw, German butchers began mass arrests of random people and mass shootings of prisoners, the people of Warsaw killed their commander, and no subsequent German commandant dared to commit such terror. When the Warsaw Uprising broke out in 1944, the Nazis in the first days began shoot civilians from the ""Wola"" district in the streets, then they killed several dozen thousand people, to terrorize the insurgents. However, those freedom fighters did not allow themselves to be terrorized and stood their ground despite the betrayal of all allies (Stalin, Roosevelt). And when the bombs fell on them, they sang an insurgent march: 

""Let the wind carry song to the city

Like spark, flaming and bloody

Let it hang above on the heaven

Can you hear it burning Warsaw!

Let it flow in the streets that you know

in the alleys where the lilacs bloom no longer

Where houses turned into fortresses 

And hearts do not calm of entusiasm""

Today this song refers to Gaza, today your houses have turned into fortresses, from these fortresses bullets are falling on the occupying army. Today Palestinian civilians are being murdered to intimidate you, we know you cannot be terrorized!

In recent years, there have already been cracks in my view of the world. But often, I could still try to rationalize things in my head. That's now truly over! It's so evident what's happening that I can't imagine that not everyone sees what I see.

Anger at how this disgusting world is put together. Disappointed in myself that I'm only now becoming actively engaged with my faith again.

But I also see the flip side. I see many people taking an interest in Islam! How beautiful, even if they only read the Quran and learn more about our faith. Perhaps it will connect us better to each other. Perhaps it will break the Islamophobia that the West has tried to indoctrinate.

We've told each other without words that we're waging an online war, haven't we? Because that's what I see happening. Israel is digging its own grave in that regard, and we are winning online!

I never said your needs/ wants were untrue, just that they're antithetical to the entire existence of Israel.

&gt; Of course Benjamin Netanyahu as our prime minister for the last 20 years is responsible for this, as well as Hamas

But this isn't just about Netanyahu. Netanyahu wasn't in power during the Nakba, he wasn't in power when Israel decided to fund Hamas, and so on. The zionism we're seeing today didn't happen in a vacuum. As you said, things aren't black and white. Netanyahu is a symptom of settler colonial state, not a seperate phenomenon. For every Bibi in the world, there are the police, legislature, judges, pencil pushers, and those in civil society who support it, and frankly, they're in power in Israel and always have been.

At this point in time, the likelihood of a 2 state solution is gone in the wind. Settlers are encroaching on what would be a future Palestinan state, the zionist regime protects them, and Gaza is being faced with genocide with Israeli politicians expressing a desire to colonize Gaza as well.

Any prospect of a two state solution was blown out of the water when Bibi and Gvir incited the murder of Yitzhak Rabin.

It is not entitled to free electricity and water from Israel, and yet Israel supplies it. Only after Gazans have killed over a thousand Israelis does Israel take away that free electricity. And why wouldn’t they? Why would they fuel terrorism against themselves?

The world agrees. And they came up with agreements on what is too far, and unacceptable, even in times of war.  And they codified these things, in documents like the Geneva convention and the UN charter.

k6zlutc,"I’ve read the relevant rules concerning allowing civilians food during a siege and I honestly can’t figure out how they might apply here in an asymmetrical kind of war without two military armies fighting each other in an area with civilians.  

In particular because despite all this talk about “blockade” and “open air prison”, the Gaza borders were open to freight (after inspection for prohibited weapons &amp; dual-use materials) and even humans with work permits on 10/6.

On MSNBC, a Gazan aid official said that before the invasion, 600 trucks/day came from the north from Israel and 100 from Egypt to the south.

I’m not sure reading these Red Cross rules of armed combat what happens during a siege if the supplies have to continue to come from the enemy across the front lines.  Doesn’t make sense to me, especially since Hamas having done the planning and the attack could have built up stockpiles of food and water for civilians just like its stockpile of rockets.

Speaking of stockpiles, Israeli media inform us that Hamas has “millions of liters of fuel” stored in its tunnels and infrastructure.  This stockpile has never been mentioned on MSNBC. It needs these to power, among other things, portable generators for the lights and fresh air ventilation shafts/fans for the tunnels, without which they would become unusable.

The “millions of liters” claim by the way is based on intercepted communications between the hospital authorities and others seeking fuel for the hospital electric generators and ambulances.  The TL;dr of those voice calls (included with the article) is that the hospitals are desperate for fuel, Hamas is sitting on a huge stockpile and it’s not sharing with their civilians.

Not sure how bog standard ICRC rules applied to other conflicts like Ukraine apply, if at all.  There’s a serious square peg/round hole issue.",1

It's unfair because the Jewish people living in Palestine at the time had (mostly) been recent migrants.this isn't the case of two nations living side by side for years and there being a new establishment of border.  This is very different than the partition between India and Pakistan as an example. 

People were also made to leave their homes (plenty of documented cases of violence being used for this) and the land and property left behind (which was then stolen) to this day hasn't been compensated.

Arabs in that region became Arab because over time they started speaking Arabic. This wasn't a foreign group who invaded it was slow cultural and religious change over time.

The issue is that the land was stolen and what the Romans did was unforgivable. But it was 2000 years ago, no one alive was affected by it and many Ashkenazi Jewish people are descended from converts to Judaism with little to no ethnic origin in that region.

Pros.
1: we can just storm Aza hamas may want to believe they can stop us but they overestimate there power we can go in once we make preparations ( bombings) .
2:They can't execute the hostages they already holding any kind of Western empathy left and if they do Israel will just become so blood thirsty they will wipe the strip in a day ( and yes Israel has the fire power) .
3: if I give in I'll be viewed as weak and people will take advantage of that
4: point 1+2 point the worst situation hamas is the terms will be in our favor in our negotiation.


Cons: your assuming that as Bibby I'll have a moral campus well no I won't .

Look we want or people and families back more then eny outside person our group but on a national level there's a need to act against hamas which takes priority that's the sad and cold truth .
We want them back and it's a very difficult situation it may seem black and white for you ( simply all for all ) but like the entire conflict it's a very complex situation . 
For example have you name checked the nemes hamas wants to release and who specifically they are aiming to release or if Israel ever used there safety as a threat  to gain something ( Hamas did
Can we even guarantee if the hostages are even alive
( we have almost zero proof which doesn't go back specifically to the 7 ) .
Will they honer there agreements ( long history of immediate breaking agreements.
250\6000

After post-WW2 redesign of Germany borders by the Allied Powers, German refugees were forcibly expelled from their homes. This was the largest single instance of ethnic cleansing in recorded history.

They left all they had to a Germany devastated by WWII, with no food or potable water. They were in refugee camps (some lasted until the 70s), but slowly, they managed to get jobs, jobs led to a stable life and a stable life led them to prosperity. They moved on.

If we start having right to return, German refugees (or the descendants of refugees) would have the right to claim Polish lands and so a war for these lands would possibly ensue.

You may be right, but the massive humanitarian catastrophe that would cause was something that the International community was unwilling to tolerate apparently. 

Israel's initial goal after the terrorist attacks was Regime change in Gaza.  They were openly messaging a full bore invasion to depose the current government and implement a new one. 

However, There are two really significant problems with this:

1. HAMAS and its more extreme cousins are well adept at hiding within the 2m+ population of the Gaza strip, and any attempt at an actual occupation would be littered with unwinnable situations where Israel has to choose between effectively prosecuting the war or causing civilian casualties that will be used against them.  (Hence Israel's demand for all 1.4 million civilians in NOrthern Gaza to evacuate - which was a virtual impossibility, but it would have given them freer hand to strike at threats where they saw them).  I think even policymakers knew that if Israel were accused with casualty counts of Civilians for every strike, every day of the war, it would quickly become unwinnable. 


2. Suppose Israel is successful. They invade the Gaza strip, impose martial law, and begin preparations for a caretaker government and democratic elections.   How does Israel get out?  They have de-facto returned to occupying the Gaza strip.   The last time they occupied it, it lasted from 1967 to 2005, and the withdrawal was terribly complicated for Israeli forces. 

I think policymakers in the US and EU are very sympathetic to Israel's problems, but they were unwilling to contemplate a renewed occupation of the Gaza strip as a reasonable solution.  Particularly when that risked a larger regional conflict. That basically leaves two military options on the table:""

1. A surgical set of missions to drive HAMA fighters out of a portion of the strip and withdraw. 

2. A larger operation seeking to de-fang HAMAS entirely, but then withdrawing and largely leaving Chaos in its wake.

Meanwhile Conservative media in the US was selling that Israel is in danger like it was in 1948.",1

Most Arabs are good at talking smack and not backing it up, they overrate themselves so much it's embarrassing, it's why Arab armies are only good for massacring unarmed civilians, just look at Iraq having infinite resources and still not being able to take an inch of Iran, who literally had the entire world against them in 1980-88, just look at the ISF and how easily they crumbled against ISIS in 2015, Saudi Arabia begging the US to stop Saddam in 1990 because they were next after Kuwait, knowing their army can't do shit, and of course, literally every one of the Arab-Israeli wars.

So what do you do? Claim everyone is an undercover Israeli/Jew as you have above!",1
k6zkgxw,"This all checks out. I grew up in a pretty observant Jewish household. Went to synagogue on Saturdays/holidays, Hebrew school, bar mitzvah, joined a Jewish youth group, took Hebrew in high school, started a Jewish fraternity on campus, did Birthright not to mention I have family in Israel who live in an established city as well as Kibbutz - so truly the whole ""nine yards.""  


  
As a young teenager of 13 I remember by uncle who lives there describe a day he was in a very Jewish side of town (he is Modern Orthodox) and got either harassed and/or assaulted. He tans very easily and was mistaken for an Arab. The story seemed to simply be brushed under the rug as if to say, ""Ey, well it is what it is."" Never to question why would my uncle was assaulted for the mistaken identity.  


In high school I was still attending Jewish study once a week until 16-17 years old. Classes during study ranged from learning about the Old Testament from different perspectives (religious &amp; modern), Hebrew study, and Jews in the news/media. You can guess which class was full of propaganda. We were shown photo and video footage of towns in Gaza and in the neighboring settlements being bulldozed, obliterated hospitals and schools etc. All to be told houses were bulldozed because they ""had to"" and buildings were destroyed by terrorists. Going as far to say terrorists placed dozens of already dead bodies in the buildings to make it look like people had died. 

  
Before entering university I didn't know what I wanted to study however the idea of joining the IDF sounded like a good idea. I had had Israeli's and Israeli soldiers visit us in the states and many of them all had the same outlook on the decades long conflict; the Jews were the people who by some miracle survived all the genocide and atrocities, we were the ones worth protecting at all costs.  


In university we rebooted a Jewish fraternity on campus that hadn't been around since probably the 70s. On campus the Muslim Students Organization set up an Israel Apartheid Week taking place. From all of my upbringing and study this phrase ""Israel apartheid"" was totally foreign. It was to be automatically assumed the students who organized this week of protest must be far right extremists who wanted to exterminate Jews. Our fraternity, along with Hillel (Jewish student organization) created a counter protest to theirs. I remember a lot of shouting from both sides but especially our fraternity president (who moved to the states from Israel in high school). He was especially fervent with calling out the other side. In my optimistic naivete I wanted to do something. These yelling matches weren't helping anyone. I was studying screen printing so I had the idea to create a shirt that combined the word for peace in Arabic and Hebrew. The word in each language not only sound similar ""salam"" and ""shalom"" but even look similar in character when written in Arabic and Hebrew (who woulda' thunk!) From a design perspective it was easy to combine the words and looked great. The shirts served a small purpose. To try and mend things my brother screened a movie at Hillel, inviting everyone but especially the students from the Muslim organization. The film documented both sides of the conflict, families who lost loved ones and how they were dealing with it all. There was open discussion afterward and I specifically remember (once again) or fraternity president getting worked up over his opinions and that of the Muslim org.   


This same president from our fraternity would later go on to shame my brother for writing an article on the apartheid, essentially calling him a traitor to his people and claiming he along with his wife are radicals.  


Flash forward 10 years. Information is even more accessible than ever. My father received an email from our relatives who live on kibbutz.

""we are very sad and angry and seek revenge although it won't help those murdered in poisoned blood by pure evil.my eyes are shedding tears the more we are exposed to the horrors carried by the human animals hamas. nothing will ever be the same again . neither the state of israel nor the gaza strip. the state of israel was established after the holocaust so that jews could live safely in their homes .the terrible failure that occurred must never happen again . israel defense forces with all the citizens of israel will make sure that such disaster cannot happen  again .with the help of president biden and the united states of america take care of yourself.""  


Note my relative does not call Arabs/Palestinians ""human animals"". This is because they are ALL viewed as ""Hamas"" through the lens of certain Israelis and Jews. This is not a sweeping assumption I came to over the last couple of weeks. It is something that has been indoctrinated into me from a very young age. And over the past number of years I have fortunately been able to shed.   


If you have gotten to the end, thanks for sticking with me. Please ask me any questions. I don't consider myself an expert however my perspective I find crucial in understanding what is going on and why so many are for and against this fucked up situation.",1

Because she is clearly dead as a doornail in that video. You need broken bones to lie like that. The fact that people told her mother that she was alive was just further terrorizing a grieving and desperate woman. 

You really, really, have to be **deeply** brainwashed if you don't believe that hamas killed civilians...

k6zjgw0,"Hamas is an Islamist Antisemitic and genocidal organization that has actively sabotaged any peace talks. They are the Muslim Brotherhood branch in Gaza and originally weren’t primarily a militant group, but a charitable group that worked with Israel. They did eventually start fighting other Palestinians who were secular nationalists at the time while Israel stood by, but when it was clear that they weren’t going to win support for that they turned hardline. They formed Hamas in 1987 with a Founding Charter that references multiple antisemitic conspiracy theories and proudly announces their intent to kill all Jews alongside other charming beliefs such as that women should stay at the home. 

They joined the PLO in its fight but then turned against them once they started peace talks to actually end the conflict. They tried to derail them by launching suicide attacks against Israel causing the PLO to crack down on them. Once the Peace Talks fell apart the PLO released their senior leaders as attack dogs and that ended up getting them kicked out of Gaza after Israel ended its occupation of Gaza and evacuated all its settlements within Gaza. Hamas then used its rule of Gaza to attack Israel and prepare it for Total War. In response Israel blockaded Gaza. 

Hamas isn’t a mere resistance group, they are like ISIS. They do not differentiate between civilian and military, not even their own. They purposefully put Gaza into the situation it is in right now and they’re not shy about their feelings about Gazans, they say that it’s better for them to die for the cause than to live in Gaza and that the Gazans are still willing to “pay the ultimate price” for their freedom. They purposefully attack near civilian infrastructure and target civilians, they sacrifice their own people because their deaths aren’t inherently a bad thing to their while their militants are safe underground and their leaders are in luxury in Doha. All of this is for the end goal of the genocide of Israelis, and a global Islamic Caliphate. These aren’t mere resistance fighters like Fatah, these are genocidal Islamists. 

They would have kidnapped, murdered, raped and paraded the corpses of the people going to these Free Palestine rally’s because that is exactly what they did to the Peace Festival.

Say what you want about Israel, but they tried peace, they tried negotiating, ending occupation, removing settlements, hell they even allowed Gazans right before the attack into Israel to work to help the economy of Gaza. I do not know what the Pro Palestine side wants other than Israelis to kill themselves.",0
k6zjg0u,What a ridiculous excuse. 3000 innocent children dead. That is not on Hamas. That is squarely on Netanyahu and the IDF. A crime for a crime is still a crime.

k6zje0h,"In May 1948, almost one million Jews lived in the Arab world. Today, fewer than 8,000 remain. When the State of Israel was founded in May 1948, the Arab regimes took revenge on the Jews. More Jews fled from Arab countries than the 710,000 Arabs who fled from Israel. At the end of the Second World War there were 50 million refugees worldwide. Today, all refugee problems from before the 1950s have been solved. All except one - Palestinian.

The UN claims there are 5.6 million Palestinian refugees. According to the international definition, refugee status is only applied to the first generation of refugees. However, the UN makes an exception for one group: the Palestinians. Descendants of Palestinian refugees are given the same status as their ancestors. Therefore, the number of so-called Palestinian refugees rose from 710,000 in 1950 to more than 5.6 million now. 

The real reason? These Palestinian refugees are used as a demographic weapon against Israel.

The 1 million Jewish refugees from the Arab world did what millions of refugees have done throughout history. They started a new life elsewhere. There are no Jewish refugee camps. Imagine if they would claim they are entitled to land in Morocco, Egypt, Syria and Iraq because their grand parents lived there 70 years ago.

And if you would look at the history of Palestine, you would find East Palestine (now Jordan) was given by the British to the Arabic islamitic Abdoellah bin Hoessein. In other words, the Palestinians already have their Palestinian state: Jordan!",1

&gt; because we care more about greed and power than we care about the people who actually keep us alive 

Who is 'we'? The overseas actors in this conflict? USA? China? Iran or Russia?

Idk about you but just as many Israelis, I have relatives and friends in army service, I pray for them every day and night. They serve to defend Israel, because if they don't, atrocities like October 7th happen. The purpose and goal of our enemy is to eradicate us. Its a war of survival, not greed and power.

About war crimes, there is no such thing a clean, sanitary, 'surgical' war. Where there is war - there will be war crimes. Ethics of war are being applied in order to minimize them.  When the methods of war are violence, death and destruction, how can you expect it to occur with 0 collateral damage? This may only be a reality when robots will fight our wars, but the probably they will turn on us because we are stupidly busy fighting each other so nvm.

This violence happens only because diplomacy failed, time after time. Israelis will say its because of Palestine, and Palestine will say vice versa, but as I see, it doesn't even matter. There is a fundamental reason why diplomacy constantly fails in this conflict. I guess you can blame both/neither sides.",1
k6zjbny,"What do you mean by “not their land”? It was no one’s land. Palestine has never been self governed. Both Jews and Arabs have always shared this land. There were both Arab and Jewish villages. Tel Aviv for instance is a Jewish city and was founded in 1909, almost 40 years before Israel was an independent country. 

Jews agreed to share the land, Arabs refused and started a war. Not that it’s relevant to the discussion, the people Hamas has butchered on October 7th are there for at least three generations. Took a mortgage, bought their house legally, didn’t steal anything from anyone.",1

This shows remarkable precision and a dedication to warn innocent can civilians of targeted areas. Also remember the death toll of 8,000 is all deaths in Gaza. It includes civilians and Hamas fighters. The count included a large number of Hamas fighters that died on the first day of their attack.

US weapons expert debunks Israel’s denial of Gaza hospital strike. Speaking to MEMO, weapons expert and US Army veteran Dylan Griffith challenged Israel's claim that it was a Palestinian 'misfired rocket' and not the Israeli military that struck the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital on 17 October 2023, killing over 500 Palestinian civilians.

Gaza forced to dig trenches for mass graves as morgues fill up. In scenes usually associated with the worst atrocities, authorities in the besieged Gaza Strip have been forced to dig huge trenches to act as mass graves for the increasing volume of dead bodies. With hospital morgues unable to cope with the volume of dead bodies, this difficult decision has been taken to avoid further pain for the families of those killed, who otherwise would have been lying in the hot sun in body bags : https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cyd1LEbqfz2/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Gaza ice cream trucks turned into morgues Hospitals in Gaza have resorted to using ice cream trucks as make-shift morgues with dead bodies overflowing amidst electricity blackouts. Israel’s air strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed more than 2,000 Palestinians who are currently trapped in the besieged Strip.

To counter your point. I would like you to think about this. Why don’t the refugees in Ukraine go live in Poland. They’re both Slavic. They’re both Christian. Why is Russian annexation such a big deal? Sounds kinda nonsensical right? 

To answer your question at its inception, Israel faced a major demographic problem. The Jewish population was outnumbered by Arab inhabitants in the region. Encouraging Jewish immigration was seen as a means to increase the Jewish population and establish a more secure foundation for the new state or outnumber the Arabs depending on how you would like to frame it.

This is because Hamas and its supporters believe that Israeli kindness is only a sign of weakness to be exploited. Hamas' mission has nothing to do with trying to improve the quality of life for Gazans in any way, especially because Hamas' leadership runs Gaza from abroad in luxury homes in places like London and Qatar. Hamas' mission is the extermination of the Jews. Hamas is attacking Jews all over the world in places like London, and Hamas is even lobbying governments around the world such as Portugal around the world to deny citizenship to Jews from Israel because it wants to keep Jews in Israel to exterminate them. If Hamas simply wanted to destroy Israel but not exterminate the Jews that Hamas would encourage other countries to take in Jews from Israel without attacking them. Since it did not but rather encourages attacks on Jews worldwide, it is abundantly clear that it is trying to exterminate the Jews.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So the support for Hamas in Gaza has nothing to do with every single  living soul in that hellhole have multiple family members murdered by  the IDF?

Nope. The IDF has only killed in self-defense. Sometimes, it kills civilians by accident and collateral damage, but risks have to be taken to protect oneself.

When Israel disengaged from Gaza and ended its occupation, Hamas attacked its fellow Palestinian militants and took over, then fired missiles into Israel, which started the blockade after. 

This isn’t another mere episode of violence, this was an intentional massacre by Hamas, that it sought to use to make Israel kill lore Gazans as well, all to destroy any prospect of peace. Hamas at every turn has tried to derail and end peace talks, this isn’t normal nor Israel’s fault, this is all Hamas fault.",0

Israel, as much as it is an antiplaestinian colonial state, is  increasingly an omplicitly antisemitic state.

Regarding what happened exactly, it changes depending on who you ask. But there is no doubt Israel inflates and exaggerated what happened. They post staged photos and don’t separate civilian and combatant deaths from the total death toll. They opened fire on hostages while they were still in Israel because they prioritize killing Hamas over not hitting their people. They also refused 2 hostages initially for who knows why. Additionally, air strikes have killed 25 journalists, so there is a question as to if they actually use precision air strikes at all, or if they use them to precisely target journalists as they looked into shutting Al Jazeera down. 

Regarding what Hamas did, there is proof of someone trying to behead someone with a shovel, they put a woman on a truck and spat on her, and took many hostages including children. And of course they opened fire on civilians. Some accounts of bodies burnt to a crisp.

k6zbolg,"Israel has been isolating Gaza, yes. They did so after they completely pulled out in 2005. But why would Israel do such a thing? Even if you do not agree with the isolation, you have to examine the reasons that it was put in place. Hamas sent suicide bombers and shooters into Jewish communities and blew up cafes, malls, movie theaters, they blew up a US diplomatic convoy. Israel pulled out and built a wall and said fuck that. Meanwhile much of the aid provided to Gaza since then was stolen by Hamas and used to build tunnels, rockets, and other military infrastructure. After disengaging from Gaza, should they have been required to allow terrorists to continue into their country and slaughter their civilians? Should Israel not bomb Hamas when they shoot rockets into Israeli cities?

And sure, we also should examine why Hamas does what they do. This is a vicious cycle because both sides run on fear and their leaders use this fear for control. This is why the issue is so complex. If Israel stops isolating Gaza, what do you do about the terrorists? And if Hamas stops attacking Israel, or accepts Israel as a nation? Should Hamas stop fighting for a ""free Palestine"" or whatever they say they stand for aside from jihad? Palestinians and many Arabs would not accept this, Hamas will lose their power, and then someone will likely fill the void. This is the Palestinian problem. Any decision that will lead them to peace will not be widely accepted, and those at the top lose their power. And they will continue to attack Israel, and Israel will continue to retaliate harder than they are hit. If they do not, their other neighbors will see that as weakness.

My instant thought was “What is Israel doing? Why are they doing this to Palestine. This is awful” and I was getting upset that so many people were siding with Israel without question. 
Then you have the video footage of Hamas kidnapping people and reports of people being brutality murdered by Hamas. So then I get confused about who Hamas is, and why they are doing this… like how I understand it is that Israel has been slowly taking over Palestinian territory over the years? Which is awful. Idk how they could do this. 
So, Hamas is the gov’t party in power, and they’re voted in? If they are why would people vote for them? Are they being forced? Are they rigging elections? 
Then you see the bombings going on in Gaza and… it’s just so difficult to “choose a side” because at the end of the day I believe it’s leadership who are fucking over the civilians. Is this about religion? Land? Culture? Power? What is it. 
I have an understanding of what is happening, but the news makes it really difficult to get a grasp of the chaos that is happening. 
It’s heartbreaking, and I just want to make everything better. Because if there is anything I can understand is a group of ppl taking over your lands. They did that to us in Canada and now we have so many issues. It’s awful.

&gt; According to polls conducted in 2019, 14.5 percent of high school students [in Dagestan] and 9 percent of teachers expressed support for those Dagestanis who joined Islamic State (IS), academic Zaid Abdulagatov reported at last week’s conference.

&gt; The poll Abdulagatov referred to is in line with a 2015 survey conducted by Dagestan’s Ministry of Youth Affairs that revealed the growing Islamization of this Russian territory and high levels of support for IS and other extremist organizations among the younger generation. **Over 8 percent of young people interviewed said they were ready to join Islamic State, while another 30.8 percent were undecided.** Many respondents indicated their wish to live in a Shariah state rather than a secular country like Russia (Universiteitleiden.nl, April 2020).

Let's start with that i'm against any unnecessary violence caused by israeli settlers or idf soldiers. We are not perfect and don't categorise all  of us as one person.

1. Britain absolutely didn't give us the land (that was inhabited by both jewish and arab people). What it did was transfer the question about the land to the UN. They had a vote and decided to divide it to roughly half the territory for israel, and half for palestine. Now one thing that you probably don't know is that Israel accepted the plan with joy, and didn't want to fight anymore. It was the arab countries that started the war, not ""zionist colonialists"". This is facts. Not propaganda. You can search it up if you want.

2. Israel **did** occupy gaza until 2005. You know why we got out of gaza? Search up the second intifada. Brutal terrorism attacks were against israeli civilians in those years. Think that you get onto a bus, regular bus, and then a terrorist bombs himself and everyone else in the bus. Do you really think this is justified? Are you going to ignore this? And after all that, we give them water and electricity for peace. Why are we entitled to give them these resources at all?

3. These people tried to cut the fence and get into Israel. Do I need to remind you what happens when they succeed entering Israel? And by the way, it's not an ""open air prison"". Every single day thousands of gazans enter Israel to work. These same people are the same people that entered and killed more than 1400 civilians.

It's not ironic, it's plain simple, the fact that my government is run by corrupted people doesn't mean my aim or wants are not true. 

Of course Benjamin Netanyahu as our prime minister for the last 20 years is responsible for this, as well as Hamas. He has blood on his hands, this is not a question. 
He sold a lie to the Israeli public about 'destroying' Hamas while he let Qatar money flow there, and paid money from Israel to Hamas as well. But it's smaller than what Qatar gave them, you can claim it's for humanitarian needs all day, the fact remains the same , Hamas still have rockets while people in Gaza don't have food, you can see clearly where that money went. 

He has responsibility for his lies, for his arrogance and for everything that happened from our side, BUT, and ""that's a big butt and I can't lie. "" 

Hamas are also responsible for what's going on in Gaza, it's not black and white, it's not just one person guilty and that's it, there are many people involved in this terror group creation. Yes, Israel government by Benjamin Netanyahu lead is part of that. So as I said, back in the first comment I still believe in a two state solution, not at all costs. 

It's risky, and this conflict is too bloody for too long, the only possible way in my opinion is that the Palestine state needs to be raised by a peace wanting group and not a terror group or any other group that doesn't want to solve this conflict in a peaceful way. I really believe that, and I really want to believe that after this people will talk differently about each other, I really hope that this will be the last straw for the better people in here, that we will had enough of blood and war in names of gods, and that we can create a reality where we are really equal, and living next to each other peacefully.",1

The third is missing context and is clearly soundbites. If she is really advocating for killing civilians and children that’s a problem. If she’s saying you cannot compare targeting children with children being “collateral damage” that’s a separate conversation 


That’s the major difference here. There’s no international celebration for killing children in Gaza.  While there was for the killing of Israeli children. 
Israel is not targeting civilians 
Hamas still targets civilians openly

k6z9054,"&gt;A dictionary definition would be “inhabiting or existing in a land from the earliest times or before the arrival of colonists”. 

That is about what the [UN defines as 'indigenous peoples'](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf). I would say these are fairly applicable distinctions for the peoples of Palestine pre-British Imperialism:

* Historical continuity with pre-colonial and/or pre-settler societies 
* Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources 
* Distinct social, economic or political system

Would you agree with these points?

&gt;Israel is a land that has been colonized, recolonized, colonized over again, and then colonized on top of that. The Arab population of the area is a product of colonization, and a huge swell of that population came from the late 19th Century onward, as Muslim nations openly pushed emigration to the area to combat the rise of Jewish immigration. (The Jewish return to their ancestral homeland which had been continually inhabited by some percentage of their population for the last 3500 years, began in the late 19th century.)

Do you have sources for that info? I find it hard to imagine there were mass migrations across great distances occured before steam engines facilitated the ease of such travel. Isn't it more likely the population stayed put while the ruling parties or classes changed? Though am not sure how one could really prove it. DNA tests are a reasonable proxy, but they are probabilistic, not deterministic, and are biased based on their initial samples. 

&gt;Between 1882 and 1914, the Arab population of the area doubled. By 1947, it had doubled again. This wasn’t due to an explosion in birth rate, it’s because the Ottoman Empire was shuttling in additional populations by the boatload. By the time the Jewish people (the descendants of the ONLY people in the area who might be considered indigenous today) declared independence from Great Britain in 1948, the overwhelming majority of Arabic peoples in the area hadn’t been living there for ‘umpteen generations’, they’d practically just gotten off the boat.

I studied economic history of West Asia (Middle East) and did not read anything about mass migrations as you describe. Do you have any sources I can read up on? I have a library card and am not afraid of books.",1

No imports or exports, no trading means no economy. No economy means no jobs and no money. No money equals poverty. Poverty equals anger. Couple their anger with IDF constantly raiding Al Aqsa and mistreating the Arab people in the West Bank, and you get people like HAMAS. In order to address HAMAS you MUST look at why they were created in the first place. This is essential when talking about this conflict.",0

False Equivalence: The passage implies that because there were no protests in London for various other conflicts or issues in the Middle East, there should be no protests for the Palestinian cause. This is a false equivalence because it assumes that every situation is the same, which is not the case.

Red Herring: It diverts attention from the Palestinian issue by bringing up other conflicts in the Middle East. This is a red herring because it doesn't address the specific concerns related to Palestine.
Cherry-Picking: The passage selectively highlights events where there were no protests for other conflicts and uses this selective data to support its argument.

Appeal to Hypocrisy: It suggests that the lack of protests for other conflicts somehow invalidates or makes hypocritical any protests for Palestine. This is an attempt to undermine the credibility of the Palestinian cause based on unrelated events.

Sweeping Generalization: The passage makes a broad generalization about ""no one marched in the streets of London"" for each of the mentioned events, which may not be entirely accurate.",1

k6z8cfa,"&gt;Humanitarian aid was blocked officially until saturday by the iof. We simply do not trust your state or president's plans to displace Palestinians in our Sinai. You calling for another country to take them sounds racist to me because it feels like this ""you're all arab, why dont u go sit together and leave us alone"" instead of understanding that we can also feel protective over our land, especially with all the concerns of expansion , excuses to break the peace treaty with lies and murders. The carpet bombing the state is doing has shown that such concerns cannot even be denied or regarded as conspiracies anymore.  Instead of condemning Egypt, (not even such a civilized country you're referring to such as that inflation and poverty has striked hard, and took many sudanese refugees, ) for not taking refugees, why not condemn your government for carpet bombing? How does this make any sense to you and not sound racist?

I do definitly condemn both: Israel´s government for any bombing without starting an evactuation of people and Gaza for sending hunderts of militants/terrorists to Israel everyday and for stopless rocketing Israel everyday (dozens of rockets fall in Gaza strip as well). 

You speak still about who isn´t right, well it is your opinion. An opponent would say, that Palestinian people do ecletct and than many interviews show how they would like to expell or kill the Jews if ""Palestine would be free"" it could be a discussion from another topic. 

However I was deffinitly not speaking about ""who is better in a war"" but about the reaction of the world and a strategy. People just take a side and don´t speak about such way. 

The only logical and fair solution would be:

1) Evacuation (all the countries together take refugees)

2) Anti-terror operation

The same says Mosab Hassan Yousef, born in Rammalah (where his father was one of the honor members of Hamas).  

""Free Gaza from Hamas. Because it is a time to win the war against a world 's most brutal organisation."" then 

""They killed so many Palestinian people at that time and this is when I decided I can not be together with them. In fact, I was asking a question, what will happen if they become a ruling party, if they succeed, what will they do? Opress and kill our people. Then I turned against them. 

Hamas are radicalist and they use Palestinian only to achieve their goal: transforming the Middle East and the world. This is Hamas´s agenda, they are not hiding by the way. This is what Israel is doing: it is a great favor to a Palestinian people. We need to evacuate civilians as much as we can, especially children and women, old people. We need to finish Hamas rule in Gaza, this is priority number one. Then we have to replace the regime, could be a Palestinian authority, Egypt government or Arab League. But firstly finish Hamas"".",0

They have rockets (made from recycled materials) which has also been confirmed by the israeli government, there are photos and videos uploaded by the idf and israeli civilians showing the damage done by these rockets when they get through the iron dome (which is about 1 in a 5,000 chance) it can barely completely destroy a car, 4 rockets hit one building and all the damage was a slightly broken roof and broken windows (this was shared by the idf and journalists, i can find them and show if you want) hamas also has 40,000 soldiers AT MOST compared to 600,000 on israel’s side + US soldiers if they decide to help out. also half of the population in gaza are children, about 1.1-1.2 million. there is a blockade, a siege, these people have no food, water or electricity and they cant leave.

You say “military goes in and destroys Hamas and then let the civilians back in afterwards”. If you think that Israel’s plan is to give Gaza back to Arabs you’re insane. And if you think that eliminating HAMAS is possible you’re very naive (not trying to insult). The more Hamas you kill, the more that will be created. The more civilians you kill, the more Hamas militants will be created. Over half the population in gaza is under 14 years old. When these kids are having their friends or brothers or sisters or mothers or fathers etc, getting blown up, they’re going to grow up with hatred for the ones who killed them. They will eventually grow up to be Hamas.

k6z6wbd,"&gt; Certainly compared to the left, Likud considered peace a much lower priority. They disliked Oslo... Netanyahu made running against it the centerpiece of his 1990s campaign, and certainly undermined it in office. Given that even Labor couldn't get to a workable Oslo type deal Likud had no chance.

Labor had their issues in making peace as well but Likud particularly bothers me because they never wanted to consider a serious 2ss at all regardless of how willing Palestinians were. Failure of peace talks involving labor and Palestinians can at least be attributed to other factors like squabbling over Jerusalem or borders and whatnot as opposed to the belief on the side of the Israeli right that Israel and only Israel has a right to the entire region which automatically shuts down any negotiations. 

&gt; That being said I think Netanyahu's Economic Peace was vastly more serious than the 2SS negotiations. Economic Peace was something that could get through the Knesset what the Palestinians were asking for was not. Further Economic Peace is a win-win situation. It avoids the problem of ""what can the Palestinians possible give worth all of X,Y,Z"". It also ducks the problem of history.

Rejecting serious political negotiations, the idea that the Israeli right might have to make some serious land concessions and rejecting a workable Palestinian state as a matter of policy while diverting more effort to economics is just silly, ignoring the political issues won't make them go away. I don't think Israel wants a strong, sustainable Palestinian middle class, since that same middle class will immediately demand political rights. I remember reading somewhere that the newfound economic status many Palestinians would find themselves in as a result of this hypothetical policy succeeding could serve as a carrot in a carrot and stick approach towards Palestinians for them to ignore political rights, after all in order to get a work permit for Israel, I believe a Palestinian needs to be uninvolved in all political activities, and is sometimes even asked to spy on his neighbors or family members. Collaborators are an essential part of the system. Perhaps there's an expectation that Palestinians will settle for relatively better living conditions that require them to be apolitical so their politics won't be an issue anymore and Israel can use them as a disenfranchised source of cheap labor since Palestinians would rely on Israel for their livelihood and thus couldn't risk it by being political? In any case Likud doesn't have a serious political framework to make any of this work in. The political and economic issues are fundamentally tied, I believe that was the position labor had which I agree with.

&gt; I think they mean it more literally. Jews and Palestinians living as neighbors in peace.

If they were using the term literally then it would imply separate states, if people are living in what essentially is the same hypothetical 1ss country they're not really your neighbors. Sort of like how Mizrahi jews and ashkenazi Jews aren't 'neighbors' in Israel, even though you might say Tel Aviv-ians neighbor Holonians. 

&gt; I partially agree. Israel has a serious problem in that the Israeli left. They want a Jewish nationality being overwhelming in Israel where the nationality is determined by race. Making Jews into a race not a nationality is a betrayal of Zionism. But in any case the Israeli left was highly influenced by European attitudes towards Arabs.
&gt; The Israeli right traditionally was much less racist. They tended to view their situation with the Palestinians as situational not racial. Jabotinsky's Iron Wall on the one hand is harsh but on the other thinks of Palestinians as equal people who just happen to be the enemy. Peace with Arabs will be achieved the same way France and Germany have peace, when they have a confluence not a conflict of interests. FWIW I agree strongly with the traditional Israeli right.

I think you're mixing them up, it is the Israeli left who view the situation with Palestinians as being situational rather than racial. The left are moreso legitimate proponents of minority and Palestinian rights as opposed to the right. It is the right who moreso make the nationality in Israel be determined by race. 

As for the Iron wall there's an unmistakable degree of racial supremacy present there. Jabotisnky was a maximalist proponent of a Jewish state regardless of to what degree it would be built at the expense of Arabs due to his ethnic/ingroup bias.",1

2. Israel does not occupy any ""palestinian territory"". We got out of gaza in 2005 and since then they have full authority to act on their own, but they choose to plan terror attacks on Israel.

From time to time, attempts are made to tamper with the fence and cross it to the Israeli side[7] as well as shooting against the IDF forces guarding the border, under the guise of violence"".

k6z43kt,"This is categorically incorrect.

Hamas wasn’t elected to any sort of full power ever. They won a slim plurality of the vote in 2006 (44% to Fatah’s 41%, with 15% of the vote going to other parties). But that was a *parliamentary* election. They had to share control with those other parties.

And they couldn’t do that. So in 2007, they orchestrated a coup and took power by force, and murdered opposition leaders. They’ve murdered over 600 opposition leaders in the years since. They rule by force and through terror.

This idea that they were elected to full power, and therefore Palestinian civilians (75% of whom were between the ages of 8 and not alive yet when the election even happened) have this coming is nonsense. Hamas as it currently rules was not elected, the took control in a civil war. And even when they did win an election, the majority of voters voted against them.",1

How they’re out in concentration camps. How they’re not allowed to walk on certain streets, how their mosques are being looted and destroyed, how they raid Palestinian churches. How they arrest and kill and torture them. Read a little bit more and you’ll see how Israel was on the verge of a CIVIL WAR a well before Oct 7th. Read even a little more and you’ll see how the Israeli’s wanted Netanyahu to step down. Read and you’ll see how Egypt wanted Israel if the attacks.

k6z1vv7,"&gt;While the pro-palestinians have no problem acknowledging Hamas' wrong and actions, going even beyond by saying they don't support it and condemn such actions

Do they? Because last I checked, Palestinians and Arabs gladly celebrated the actions of Hamas on the 7th.

&gt;Pro-Israeli, on the other hand, are so blinded by their thirst for supremacy and power that they completely forget about the actions of the IDF and Israeli governement for the past 75 years

Is that so? Because even in this sub, many people will condemn some of Israel's actions. You know why? Because not all actions are worth to be condemned.

&gt;You cannot sit there and continue to defend your governement when they have committed 77+ war crimes according to UN and international laws

According to the same UN, which the general secretary won't even condemn Hamas and blame Israel? The same UN who has Iran, Russia, China etc... In their human and women rights councils? Yeah, so excuse me for not trusting the UN. And what international laws did Israel break?

&gt;When Palestinians are restricted in their movement and have no independence, no privacy and no Freedom

And who's fault is it that they don't have independence? Surely not the fault of themselves who refused every single peace treaty and the opportunity to build a sovereign state.

And who's fault is that they have no privacy and freedom? Surely not the fault of themselves that they constantly launch terror attacks.

You seriously can't even hold them accountable for their actions. Everything they do is the fault of Israel, right? Palestinians have no accountability at all.

&gt;Hamas wasn't there before 87, yet the killing of civilians happened since the beginning.

And Israel wasn't there before 1948, yet the killing of Jews happened since the late 1800's.

&gt;So convenient for Israeli to have an enemy to fight off everytime

So convenient to be ""knowledgeable"" on a situation you probably didn't even hear of until a month ago, while you live far away from the area, which you never even visited.

&gt;why are people in Israel protesting against the actions of the governement

Israelis want to have the hostages returned first. That is their priority. Their second priority is to eliminate Hamas. That's why they protest. Because Israel's priorities are opposite. First eliminate Hamas and then return the hostages.

&gt;why are jews all around the world protesting in support of the Palestinians?

In before you're gonna show me a picture of Neturei Karta. A group so small, they probably don't even make 1% of the Jewish population.

&gt;Are the 120 countries that voted yes for a ceasefire deluded? 

And why should Israel care about such vote?

&gt;Is it normal for the US to put their veto for an issue that doesn't concern them? Oh yeah right, it does concern them... Wanting power, petrol and money is more important than human lives I guess

So you're blaming Israel for getting support from the US? Hmm I wonder why you would do such thing.

&gt;And yes I can tell you that these 7000 deaths are civilians. Go check the official 212 pages document the palestinians authority (PA) has just released. Names of all the victims with age and sex.

And can you tell me who's a civilian and who isn't? Oh that's right, you can't, because Hamas doesn't say. You're immediately assume that this list is entirely civilian.

&gt;You're gonna tell me now that new-born babies and 5 years Olds are terrorist or Hamas?! Are you this serious?

It seems like you're the one who says it.

&gt;For the CTV cameras, they are pointed into the Palestinaians house

Those are not Israeli cameras. Israel doesn't install them.

&gt;Checkpoints, infringement of liberty of movement

And you failed to answer when these checkpoints came to be and why. ""Whatever I say, goes in one hear and exits the other.""

&gt;But I gues it's normal for you, for a 2million + people to be encircled and trapped in a human case with no control of their water and electricity supply

I'm confused. Because clearly you're talking about Gaza here, but you mention checkpoints who don't exist in Gaza. You're ao ipl informed that you don't even know the difference between Gaza and the West Bank. Which comes to my conclusion that you're unknowledgeable and have zero relations to this conflict.

&gt;Btw you drew a comparison with Bin laden. Are you seriously comparing Bin laden and his militants to civilians 

Where did I compare bin laden to *CIVILIANS*?

&gt;And anyways when they killed Bin laden they avoided civilian casualties

Yeah, they only killed his entire family.

&gt;something the IDF should take as an example since they can't even aim properly and hit Egypt.

You're talking about aiming properly while 20% of Hamas rockets land in Gaza. Heck, even launches from Lebanon land in Syria. Yemen launched a drone last week that hit Egypt.

But I don't see you talking about that right? Because that's normal Arab violence. It's only important when Jews are involved.

&gt;You say the jews are indeginous to the land, go read and not the ones written by Israeli authorities or media.

So the definiton of indigenousity is written by the Israeli authority or media? Sounds pretty anti.... to me.

&gt;An indeginous people means that they are the EARLIEST civilization to the land

Yeah, which are Jews.

&gt;The land of Canaan, where Canaanites, Amorites, Assyrians, Hamites and Arabs were present before the jews

You do realize that the Arabs came to this land in the 7th century, while Jews lived here? Oh, you probably don't. So id Jews lived here before Arabs, by *YOUR* words, Jews are indigeous.

&gt;Even with the story of Moses peace be upon him. He took the enslaved jews out of Egypt to move to Canaan, a promised land of God according to them. How can they move to a place they are already supposed to be there.

Again, you're using the Torah. No Jew uses this argument.

&gt;You're gonna tell me about the argument about the fact that there were jews 3000 years later, well there were peoples before that. 

Yeah, and? Jews are the *OLDEST* group of people who lived in the region. Unless you know an existing Canaanite group of people, Jews are the oldest group.

&gt;Regardless of this argument, what is important is that in 48, when holocaust survivors arrived

Only you're forgetting that Jews immigrated long befor 1948.

&gt;Palestinians with passeports, with land of their ancestors that were them displaced during the 1948 war. 

Most of the land wasn't occupied, nor privately owned. Oh, and can you tell me who Palestinians were pre 1967? A name of a famous Palestinian pre 1967? Because I asked that question multiple times and no one was able to give me an answer. Maybe you could, because you're clearly so knowledgeable.

And like I said in my last comment, it is clear you have no real idea about the conflict, and that you are being brainwashed by Al Jazeera and tiktok videos.

k6z1moy,"I don't think it's true that they are bombing ""all over"" southern Gaza. You said that for rhetorical effect. It's the northern area that is receiving most of the shelling.

Bombing a hospital is not actually a war crime if the hospital is being used to host non-medical military operations. It becomes a legitimate target then. You're right, I don't know if this exact hospital has military equipment in it, but neither do you. The tenability of both our positions hinges on this fact. However, what we do know is that it is a pattern of behavior for Hamas to use residential areas.

You don't have to be a monster to bomb a hospital; you just need to have a sense of self-preservation. What is being lost in all these discussions about this conflict is the Israeli point of view. Hamas launches thousands of rockets that reach inside the borders of Israel. Thankfully, carnage is often averted due to the Iron Dome, but not always. Isn't that worth considering?

Yeah, I know. The protest for rohingyans happened, its just the world see them as no value. The media could not care less. maybe if we bomb a few places in their name, maybe then the world would care.

&gt;I do support humanity, but I truly don’t know what is humane thing to do when a nation is attacked and civilians massacred? I don’t want to see dead babies in Gaza or Israel… when the world was appalled by Isis crimes against people the protested it. There was a war, just in Mosul, the stronghold of Isis there were thousands of civilian death, babies, women… was it not horrible? It was… my heart aches to each and one of them, but should have US and the coalitions not fought Isis? How do you fight a terrorist regime? Giving cookies or concessions doesn’t help.

To you its a terrorist regime, to others its their freedom fighter. It's an ideology. But if you want to win, you fight them with hope. American won the fight with ISIS in iraq by helping the then government to re-enfranchise the sunnis into the government. Then the Iraqis themselves, with the help of the Americans and coalition, helped and supported them. 
In Malaya ( before the formation of Malaysia), we defeated communist insurgency with the simple act of getting our independence from the British. The ideologies never gonna go away. ISIS and communist are still around, but they are weak, and people do not need them.

Right now, you bombing them are not gonna solve anything. Try empathy. Put yourself in the shoes of a Palestinian. If you are in gaza, you only hope is Hamas. If you are looking for hope for a place without Hamas, you will see West Bank as an example. Do you think you would like to live in West Bank as a Palestinian?

And how all Hamas can do is sit there and count there incredibly little victories... like, ""Well, at least Netanyahu will probably get voted out next term""...

I'm pretty sure you know that's what I'm talking about too... Palestine was under review as a potential new home before ww2 even broke out.

2- The world is not supporting the genocide and ethics cleansing that's taking place, but the world has always been supporting Israel's cause to make up for thier ww2 guilt. What Israel tried to achieve is apartheid and succeed, what do you call the ethnic segregation with the 5 resident cards? Even the arab israelis who have accepted your terms and live among you are discriminated against legally.

3- You can thank your government for the existence of Hamas in the first place... I never condone violence, but you're just cleaning your own mess at this point.

4- The Holocaust is a stain on history and the human consciousness. But it doesn't justify stealing someone else's home. Why didn't the UK make a place for you there, why didn't the US make some space for you there? Why send you off to the middle east? They literally called you an investment.
Palestinians are the confused segment that had that reality imposed on them since the start, why would they be okay it? Is violence the answer? No. But violence has been your government's approach... Do you know how many massacres the Palestinians have been through just between 1937 and 1948 here are 44 of them (https://thepalestineproject.medium.com/notorious-massacres-of-palestinians-between-1937-1948-ae4f4d1f61d0)
This is the foundation of your relationship with the Palestinians.

5- call it whatever you want to call it, people are dying, people out being starved out and cut off from the rest of the world with every aspect of their lives under heavy control. 2913 children as of October 26.

6- We can argue about scholars all day but eventually the facts are there for those looking, I'm talking from a historical perspective no more. And no, Jews, Muslims and Christians in that region have always coexisted locally, they kill each other every now and then in the name of god because that was all the rage back then but I visited Syria before the war and I met all kinds of people there, been to synagogues, churches and mosques... The issue is that you want a jew only state, a theocratic state. A ludicrous demand in this day and age. 
No one wants you to go like a lamb to the butcher, no one wants you to leave even, they just want you to actually coexist in the land you came as refugees to... No one goes to a new country and demands to start their own in it.

7- look man, you do you, the Americans killed the natives and now say sorry in the most ridiculous ways but it doesn't bring back the dead, that will eventually be you once you finish wiping out the native population.

There’s a bunch of evil in this world and the only way to keep the good people safe is to get rid of the filth that’s walking amongst us. 

Israel attempted to be diplomatic by pulling their militaries out of certain pockets in the region like Gaza, West Bank, etc. Israel currently has many Muslims/Palestinians living amongst them in their territories, and Israel even has elected officials within their own government from the other side. 

They have done everything humanly possible to resolve this conflict in a civil matter and it’s constantly being thrown back in their faces. Even Egypt refuses to allow refugees from entering their country because they know the hate that overflows in Gaza and the West Bank. They’re not ignorant enough to put their people in jeopardy. 

No matter what you say I 100% stand by my statement and hopefully it comes to fruition so future generations will understand in order to eliminate evil in the world, you need to cut the entire cancer out from the roots.

And maybe that’s a motivation for citizens’ opposition, but I very much doubt that it’s any of their governments’ reasoning: Seems much more likely that they want to leave Palestinians in the OPT because dealing with the Palestinians diverts Israeli resources which might otherwise be invested in ways that make Israel even more of a regional power.",1

1) You’re forgetting the Palestinians never traveled to where you are to terrorize you. It was the other way around when you went to Palestine. (hence you see a lot of videos of Jews screaming “another Nakba”, calling for the genocide of Arabs. They know their history, yet they’re okay with it.

2) What do you think comes out of 75 years of oppression? Arabs have been called terrorists for decades even though America has been terrorizing the Middle East. You calling them terrorists doesn’t faze them 

3) Palestinians tried to peacefully protest in 2018. How did that turn out? Israel has a full genocide agenda, they see even little Palestinian babies as future terrorists and they have bombed over 1000 babies so far, yet they have to make up 40 baby beheaded story. 

4) If you look at history, supporting Israel is like supporting a terrorist group, yet they’ll turn around and call Hamas a terrorist. Israelis killing Rabin for signing peace with Arafat. (Their old prime minister but a right wing nut fan assassinated him incited by Ben netencunt). Collective punishment, used by terrorist organizations (terrorize the public for political gain) for those that don’t know what terrorist actually means, you just like to toss it around. The mutilation and forced contraceptive of black females in Israel. They are very openly racist in Israel it’s an all white Jewish state. 

I can go going and can continue listing for hours what Israel is like. It’s a terrorist state supported by the western world, just like Al-Queda and ISIS. America funded them to topple leaders in the Middle East and it came back to bite them. Bibi funded Hamas to topple Arafat and now Hamas is a terrorist. Ya’ll have done this too many times for it to work, can’t keep using the same old play book.

k6ywqdb,They are PEOPLE. What are WE doing?,1
k6ywq9o,"&gt; I mean they are not serious people in regards to making peace.

Certainly compared to the left, Likud considered peace a much lower priority.  They disliked Oslo... Netanyahu made running against it the centerpiece of his 1990s campaign, and certainly undermined it in office. Given that even Labor couldn't get to a workable Oslo type deal Likud had no chance.  

As an aside, it would have been much better for the Palestinians had Abbas worked with Kerry rather than letting the idea settle in that Abbas wasn't serious about peace, but we are discussing Likud not the PA. 

That being said  I think Netanyahu's Economic Peace was vastly more serious than the 2SS negotiations.  Economic Peace was something that could get through the Knesset what the Palestinians were asking for was not. Further Economic Peace is a win-win situation.  It avoids the problem of ""what can the Palestinians possible give worth all of X,Y,Z"".  It also ducks the problem of history. 

&gt; Besides, they are contradicting themselves when they talk about 'good neighborliness'.

I think they mean it more literally.  Jews and Palestinians living as neighbors in peace.

&gt; Likud certainly is incapable of proposing or implementing any form of remotely good-faith attempt at a 1ss that has a chance of working.

I partially agree.  Israel has a serious problem in that the Israeli left. They want a Jewish nationality being overwhelming in Israel where the nationality is determined by race.  Making Jews into a race not a nationality is a betrayal of Zionism.  But in any case the Israeli left was highly influenced by European attitudes towards Arabs. 

 The Israeli right traditionally was much less racist.  They tended to view their situation with the Palestinians as situational not racial.  Jabotinsky's Iron Wall on the one hand is harsh but on the other thinks of Palestinians as equal people who just happen to be the enemy.  Peace with Arabs will be achieved the same way France and Germany have peace, when they have a confluence not a conflict of interests.  FWIW I agree strongly with the traditional Israeli right.

Under Netanyahu and to some extent before that the Israeli Right became Populist.  In many ways it has blurred the the two so now quite often Palestinians are enemies because of their racial conflicts of interest.  Obviously that's a doctrine that is both morally objectionable and makes peace impossible.   Netanyahu ends up talking out of both sides of his mouth sometimes sounding like a member of the KKK and sometimes sounding more like Reagan's vision for a warm peace with the future Russia once the Soviet Union falls. I'm optomistic enough to believe the real Netanyahu in his heart believes in his own Economic Peace, and the racist appeals are immoral election opportunism.  But at the same time behavior changes belief, it is possible the Netanyahu of 15 years ago was a different man than the one of today. 

So my TL:DR version is that Likud's platform is a serious peace platform were it run by the Likud of the 1980s.  Under the Likud of the 2020s it isn't.  But the Likud of the 2020s isn't serious in a whole lot of ways peace just being an important example.",1

At the same time it also doesn’t mean that they are targeting civilians 100% of the time. But that does bring me to a few valid questions - they say they have been targeting residential buildings, schools, and hospitals because they are trying to get to the underground tunnels, although those tunnels seem pretty unaffected by the airstrikes…why do they keep doing it? And if the hostages are supposedly inside the tunnels…? I also wonder why they keep targeting journalists…seems like the oldest trick in the propaganda playbook - eliminate any source of truth. 

Dude don’t show me sh!t of “people celebrating”. I truly could not give less of a fuk. If you were living under military siege and had experienced intense Israeli bombardment not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4 but 5 TIMES over the span of less than 20 years, I’m pretty sure you would celebrate too. 

I’m talking about the people in the first innocent civilians video you linked and not the second. Obviously anyone directly involved in the second are not innocent but they are also not the people in question (bystanders are still innocent though).

But the first? If showing a sense of relief in response to your oppressor getting a taste of his own medicine (as any HUMAN would) makes you “not innocent” then what about Israeli complicity in maintaining and perpetuating an apartheid state? What about IDF soldiers who have committed crimes against Palestinians when Hamas is not involved? Oh and Israeli settlers in the West Bank then are DEFINITELY not innocent in that case….

I have videos of people chanting death to Arabs and TikTok upon TikTok of Israelis mocking the suffering of Gazans. So I guess they’re also not innocent?

k6yvjhd,"&gt; When you’re given something unlawfully, it’s still stealing.

Stealing what? A land given to us? Unused by anyone?

&gt; thousands of Palestinians are being massacred 

What of it? They support ethnic cleansing. The chant ""From the river to the sea"" is sung there like a children's song. The civilians were the ones who sold information to Hamas for their assault.

&gt; ""Nazi"" and ""Jews"" to ""Israel"" and ""Palestinians"". 

I don't think you get it, there is no Palestine. There is an annoying misconception that Palestine was a state, it wasn't. There are documentations showing how it was just a bunch of Jews, Arabs, and Christians around the country, usually Jews were the minority in the land, but either way, it was mostly fine, excluding the recurring manslaughter against Jews by extremists.  
So say that it was injustice or unlawful all you want, but what's better, a land unruled with a house of innocents being murdered every now and then, which you won't hear about because no one would cover it, or a land lead in democracy (not the greatest government, I'd admit, but still something), unlike Hamas, which leads in hate and terrorism.  


TL:DR   
Wanna support your so called ""Palestinians""? Support taking out Hamas, they're the enemy, both for Israeli citizens, and Gazans. They committed the mass shootings, they raped and burned innocents. They ARE animals, and will be treated as such.

As well as the assassination of Franke Bernadotte who actually did broker a deal with Israel, Britain, and Palestine but Zionist forces ended his life tragically early. ( Haganeh disbanded in 1948 becoming the Israeli Defense Force core fighting members)

I have a hard time finding a time when israel initiated a war just for the sake of it.
Also, throughout the short 75 years of existence, it has made so many compromises regarding its land (sinai, gaza, south lebanon, oslo accords, y accords) its pretty clear it is not interested in expanding and willing to reach agreements if they can lead to it's safety.

And about the ethnic cleansing part of what you said, also quite a pathetic comment on you side.
There are millions of arab citizens who live in israel and are a part of the country. Most of these arabs are not ethnically different from the Palestinians in gaza or the west bank.

Also israel has proven to take so many actions that are meant to minimize the killing of cevellians. Things such as notifying danger bombs, making phone calls, dropping pamphlets and throwing little warning bombs before the actual attacks (this is called ""knock on the door"". These are things no other army does, let alone one that is interested in genocide.

While the pro-palestinians have no problem acknowledging Hamas' wrong and actions, going even beyond by saying they don't support it and condemn such actions, Pro-Israeli, on the other hand, are so blinded by their thirst for supremacy and power that they completely forget about the actions of the IDF and Israeli governement for the past 75 years. You cannot sit there and continue to defend your governement when they have committed 77+ war crimes according to UN and international laws. When Palestinians are restricted in their movement and have no independence, no privacy and no Freedom. You all are the truly blinded ones. So much for the ""chosen people of God"".

Hamas wasn't there before 87, yet the killing of civilians happened since the beginning. But anyways, you're gonna tell me that before that there was such, and after there will be such. So convenient for Israeli to have an enemy to fight off everytime. Just like it was so convenient to kill the jews during wwii because they were deemed the enemy by the same means of propaganda that Israel is doing right now. 

Riddle me this then, why are people in Israel protesting against the actions of the governement, why are jews all around the world protesting in support of the Palestinians? Are they brainwashed too? Are the 120 countries that voted yes for a ceasefire deluded? 

Is it normal for the US to put their veto for an issue that doesn't concern them? Oh yeah right, it does concern them... Wanting power, petrol and money is more important than human lives I guess...
 

And yes I can tell you that these 7000 deaths are civilians. Go check the official 212 pages document the palestinians authority (PA) has just released. Names of all the victims with age and sex. More than half of them are children. You're gonna tell me now that new-born babies and 5 years Olds are terrorist or Hamas?! Are you this serious? Whatever I say, goes in one hear and exits the other. You're probably gonna tell me this document is false also. 

For the CTV cameras, they are pointed into the Palestinaians house. It's an infringement of private life. Checkpoints, infringement of liberty of movement. But I gues it's normal for you, for a 2million + people to be encircled and trapped in a human case with no control of their water and electricity supply. 

Btw you drew a comparison with Bin laden. Are you seriously comparing Bin laden and his militants to civilians ?! And anyways when they killed Bin laden they avoided civilian casualties, something the IDF should take as an example since they can't even aim properly and hit Egypt. Oh but that's fine cause it was a mistake and civilians are used as human shields. 

You say the jews are indeginous to the land, go read and not the ones written by Israeli authorities or media. An indeginous people means that they are the EARLIEST civilization to the land. The land of Canaan, where Canaanites, Amorites, Assyrians, Hamites and Arabs were present before the jews. For them to claim they are indeginous, means that when jews arrived no one was previously there. Even with the story of Moses peace be upon him. He took the enslaved jews out of Egypt to move to Canaan, a promised land of God according to them. How can they move to a place they are already supposed to be there. You're gonna tell me about the fact that there were jews 3000 years ago. well there were peoples before that.  

Regardless of this argument, what is important is that in 48, when holocaust survivors arrived, THERE WERE PEOPLE ALREADY THERE. Palestinians with passeports, with land of their ancestors that were them displaced during the 1948 war. 

Check yourself in the mirror. According to you collective punishment is the solution and civilians should just continue to die without proper care. Great to see your morals.

k6yuxz5,"I'll start by saying this story is really not relevant to the Gaza situation.

This was on a Mediterranean cruise, mostly in Greece, but with one stop in Turkey. I was traveling with a friend who suffered a ruptured ovarian cyst, resulting in life-threatening blood loss. A Turkish hospital surgically intervened to close it and remove 1.5L (3 pints) of blood from her abdomen.

Within 30 minutes of the anesthesia wearing off, a hospital administrator came to her room and demanded $40,000 immediately. Of course she doesn’t have that readily available. This man would proceed to show up to her room every hour and demand payment from her, telling her to call anyone she knows (note: due to the time zones, Americans hadn't woken up yet that morning).

On day 2, he continues to show up to her room every hour. He informs her that they will physically stop her from leaving the hospital until she pays. They do not work with American insurance, and they do not accept payment plans. That's when I found [this article](https://travelnoire.com/couple-say-they-cant-leave-turkey-until-they-pay-18000-medical-bill), shockingly similar to our own story, and realized that we were functionally in a hostage situation; either we pay money or my friend is indefinitely detained with no legal recourse.

My friend called the consulate, and basically, their response was, ""well what's your plan?"" They don't really have any assistance to offer. They cannot intervene in this extralegal detention, nor advocate for her in any way.

This story ends up less dramatic because on day 3 we found someone with the means to pay the bill.

[Al Haq is an example of these, it was classified as a terrorist organisation in 2021 without evidence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Haq#)

There are ofcourse other High Profile cases of Israel killing civilians without just cause, Shireen Abu Akleh is one of the more famous ones, but they bomb schools and hospitals on the regular and will just claim that Hamas was there, theyre everywhere according to the government. Its a catch all to protect them from backlash. Noone is saying that 100% of the bombings are unjustified either, there are going to be bombs dropped on legitimate targets and these cases will be used as ""proof"" that all of the bombings are justified. Its not disimilar from the US classing all adult men as terrorists in Iraq or Afghanistan. It does not make them legitimate targets.",0

It could easily embolden ISIS style groups to rebel against the corrupt governments in places like Jordan and Egypt which could easily lead to civil war in an attempt to establish some extremist caliphate like we saw a decade ago in Syria and Iraq.,0

Frankly- I didn’t have sympathy for Hamas before but you keep this up and people are going to support them just to spite the Israeli supporters  manipulating the bots (tongue in cheek &amp; exaggeration for effect.)

First-it was not instant backlash. America spent months back and forth with the UN and the government of Afghanistan about them hosting Al-Qaida.  We would have accepted(&amp; did demand) that the government of Afghanistan turn over all of the leadership and others who were part of Al-Qaida.  They were given the option and they chose to defend the terrorists.  I don’t believe Israel ever contacted Hamas’s diplomats to negotiate a solution to the attack—and I am being sarcastic here because that gets into the other factual error which makes this argument a fallacy.  

Israel spent over 50 years preventing Gaza/Palestine from being a self-governing and legit government.  Before 2005, they never tried to help them establish leadership, a military, invest in infrastructure (BTW-all things the US did during the war)

To be blunt- Israel is like that parent who had an unruly child and throughout their pre-adolescence they attempt to beat the kid into submission THEN the kid hits the late teen years and they throw their hands up and say “you are society’s problem now” refusing any responsibility for what they raised.  THEN the kid turns 18, commits some heinous crime which they must be held accountable for BUT we all recognize the kid never stood a chance because he never was given the chance to develop the necessary social skills, understand other’s boundaries or problem solve.

I and many others would be much more sympathetic to the parents (&amp; the Israelis) if they spent 15 years helping the kid (Palestine) become a functioning adult who then made a choice to go the wrong way.  And that is what happened in Afghanistan.  They were given the option to discipline and do the right thing in 2001.  They didn’t.  The  child (al-Qaida) became a bigger, stronger kid and the US went in to prevent a worse threat from growing to adulthood.  We gave them EVERY resource to fix things and the Taliban wasn’t interested.

Germany, for instance, lost WWII. They lost territory. They gave up, negotiated their surrender, and moved on with their lives. Millions of Jewish people lost their homes in WWII. That wasn't fair. But Jews have not been fighting for 75 years to get their homes in Germany back. They became refugees and moved to other places. Like every other group of refugees except the Palestinians.

Israel wants and needs to end Hamas.

Every war has civilians casualties that can't be disputed - the civilian population always suffers, and the most suffering have kids - it's a very, very sad fact.

In a war u have to kill ur Military opponent, otherwise u will not win the war.

Israel has military bases at which Hamas could aim -  which they don't, they just shoot their rockets anywhere without targeting any military - the Hamas charter openly has a Jewish genocide in their charter, so killing civilians is the plan, hence they don't need to ""aim"" at anything - so there is one thing that can't be argued about: 

Hamas wants a genocide, that's their goal - but everyone including u is ignoring that

Israel wants to kill Hamas fighters. 
Hamas has no military bases for Israel to aim at, they hide their bases and rockets within and under houses and hospitals - that is also an undisputed fact.

So what in ur opinion should Israel do? 

Currently they bomb any houses of which they have information on some sort of Hamas base/usage  - considering this is all that they can do to fight Hamas that's and it's as fair a game as it can get when ur opponent uses it's own civilians as a human shield - the latter if which is war crime alone.

Ur argument that Israel is doing a genocide is a direct result of Hamas giving 0 fucks about their own civilians - Israel does to some extent do roof knocking, mass phone calls and flyers dropped from planes.

All of those 3 things is much more of what Hamas is doing to protect the ppl if Gaza

Not believing rape victims without needing them to be named/exposed or seeing “proof” is some incel shit. I’m guessing you don’t have many (any?) female friends or relationships in your life. Most of them are dead, they were raped and killed… I would never want the families to have to provide proof their daughter/sister spent their last moments in total horror just to convince people like you.


If you need more proof that Islamic terror is the face of evil… You are out of your mind. It is literally a death cult started by a murderous 9th century warlord. The whole world wants them dead, there is no better use of my tax dollars than killing those animals. 

Russia-Ukraine is nothing like this conflict… If Ukrainian terrorists had stormed into Russia and RAPED/murdered civilians, they would justified to retaliate. They didn’t… If anything, Hamas is Russia in this (dumb) scenario. 

The fact you think this war was manufactured to Israel’s advantage is just… Dumb. Do you also believe in the Illuminati? There is no grand conspiracy afoot here bro, no shadow cabal of governments performing false flag operations. Just regular old dirty Islamic terrorists. 

Do you know how much bombs cost? How much war costs? Wages for the 100s of 1000s reservists called into action? Of course Israel is losing money… War is the most expensive activity possible. 

You are not supporting liberation… You are supporting terror, whether you know it or not. I can’t believe Hamas propaganda is this effective. 

Does Gaza look liberated to you? The place is going to be leveled… There will be a massive minefield to protect the border, effectively reducing their usable land. 

Supporting this violent resistance is not only anti-Israel, it’s actively supporting Palestinian casualties… There is no world where Palestine gets “freedom” through violent resistance.

When Israel left Gaza, there were *no* restrictions on Gaza.
Not only that, Israel continuously provided water, electricity, fuel, money and medical supplies.
Only once NaziHamas ( who, I remind you, is openly Nazi) took hold on Gaza, and only after they kidnapped an Israeli soldier, Israel started.teh blockade.

3. Again, wrong. The reason for this war is not to return the hostages. It is certainly one of it goals, but not the first one.
The first goal is to eradicate NaziHamas organisation. It is the only way for peace. In can you were not aware of it, Israel already made an exchange of prisoners deal with NaziHamas, and freed ~1000 terrorists. Guess what? The leaders of the Oct 7th pogrom are those released prisoners.

The Arabs, from even before WW2, attacked us Jews, in similar manner the Oct 10th pogrom.  We wish having peace with the Palestinians and put this stupid land dispute behind us for a better future for the world. We are even willing to give up land to get this peace, as we did in Habron, Jenin, Gaza.
I can assure you, if Gaza would have been a success, that could have lead to peace across the world. But, on every occasion, the Palestinians chose war and hatred over peace and prosperity. The outcome of the Oct 10th pogrom is that there will be no peace for the next 100 years. And that Israel doesn't have a choice - it must remove NaziHamas from the face of the earth.

5. I am sorry, you do not fully understand what holocaust is.
What is happening in Gaza is a war. Like there was a war against the Nazis in WW2. They also had civilians casualties., by the Allies forces. The US nuked the Japanese twice(!!). This is a war. An ugly war. A war that could have been avoided if NaziHamas would not launch the Oct 7th pogrom. 

6. I read Chomsky. He is an Idiot, and would not survive the world he is preaching for.
He spoke about ""what would the world choose if they had a chance"".
The awful truth is that if you ask all of the world, the majority would vote for the annihilation of the Jews. It does not mean I should go as a lamb to the butcher.

7. I am a Zionist Jew. Israel is my only home. I have nowhere to go. I will fight till the end.",1

I think many leftists like yourself view the situation as follows: ""The palestinian people do not support hamas, they are a peace loving, progressive people, just like anyone in the West. They just want to be free, have a free economy, give their people the freedom to express their religion, thoughts, sexual preferences, etc as they please.

k6yq3hn,Hmmm the country that hosts the Hamas leaders ? Something seems off there,1
k6yq345,"&gt;it was only due to the first intifada that they were confined to the Gaza Strip.

Everybody knows that before the Oslo accords , the  borders of  former Palestine (Eretz Yisarel , if you are touchy )  were reunited since 1948  after 1967 , but that's hardly relevant .  Only a minority of Palestinians travelled beyond thier areas , and the situation was mostly a continuation of pre-1967 being a military occupation ; the only differences is that Israeli-Jews as the occupying power  were better in some ways (freer media , better mobility as you said etc .) , and worse in others ( Human right abuses , a worse  economy etc ) .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;the Gaza Strip was captured in a defensive war.

""Defensive"" as justification for perpetual occupation is just an Israeli-national myth .  

There was no need for an occupation in the West Bank as an example ; every one at the time knew the Hashemites had  no interest in actively invading Israel  , and instead only retired themselves to launching rockets for the sake of preserving their reputation in Arab politics .

Gaza was once occupied in 1956   ; Israeli-Jews left it within 2 years  , and not stay for half a century .

Should the Vietnamese occupied Cambodia for 20 years ?  , Should the British have marched to Buenos Ares because of the Falkland islands in the 1980s ?   .  

Defense is proportionate defense : any more  is merely opportunist  aggression .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prior to the outbreak of World War II Jews weren’t known for killing Germans, it was only after they started murdering Jews that the Jews fought back.  


Same case with Palestinians . There was no trouble until the First and Second Aliyah started to purchase lands and cause depopulation of entire villages and hamlets  , or impoverishment denying  them resources of purchased areas through worker exclusion  or disrupting grazing rights .

Similarly : things didn't escalate to involve  all of Palestinians rather than a dozen or so villages  before Balfour's declaration   , or escalate into an armed rebellion in 1936 .

 Israelis always cry about ""security"" ; yet said security is more about continuing violating others , rather than their own actual safety .

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;all the Nazis had to do to stop the Jews from fighting back was stop killing Jews.

Same case is here : except the Israeli-state dosen't kill Palestinians , but far worse: wrecking their lives for decades while taking what's left of the region while they are alive ... such generational anguish is painful . 

What Ashkenazi Jewry been through from 1933-1945 , simply isn't comparable to Palestinians in 1878 Petah Tiqvah to today .  The former was a sad chapter  ; the later is roughly half of their modern history when   excluding the 18th century  Zaydani Sheikdom . 

&amp;#x200B;

OP doesn't claim the situations  are a copy-paste of each other   . What he claims is that there are parallels we should be weary of  as to avoid potential ethically catastrophic disasters .  The National Socialists too claimed that the WWII was self-defense , mixing in paranoia , ambition , and fact  .

Let me address your points as you’re the only one actually discussing. 

1- if you think we don’t have the right to defend ourselves = you might hate Jews, I don’t have anything to argue about this point rather than saying we are here now and we are defending ourselves corresponding to 7/10 attack specifically and from the continuous rockets fired towards us ever since, if you say it’s a action and reaction, well I can say in controversy that what Israel does is reaction to years upon years of rockets fired at us with no divide between civilians cities to military bases. 

2 - you’re taking all of our legitimacy to have our own Jew country with stating that it was just to “get Jewish people out” which is anti-Semitic statement by itself. 

3- first of all, in 48, doesn’t matter for what reason you think to yourself, we got the right to establish a country. 2 countries to be precise, which one side (the so called ‘palastines’ even though there were no country named like this) didn’t want this, yet Jews were ok with that. Anyways we established our country, years later they true to fight us over the lands we had, but we managed to prevail this war and got more space, just like a lot of countries that occupied extra lands and now no one talks about what was before. In that 47 UN vote, 33 were for 13 against and 10 neutral; so we had the full legitimacy. 

4- this is ridiculous. First of all because we have no where to go back, most of the people that came to Israel, came from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Morocco, and so on from ALL the Arab countries. I don’t need to tell you that we cannot go back there, right? I myself one part Yemen other part Persian (mom from Yemen dad from Persia / Iran). We got kicked out from the lands and came to Israel. Please return all the lands there ( and we had ALOT of lands there) before suggesting us to leave Israel. 

5- it’s not a stupid question, because instead of becoming this monster people, they could use all the assistance, same as we had, to become strong developed nation, but they didn’t, unlike us, we thrive the land and cleansed it. Please look at footage / document on how we got the land and what we made it to be. Asking us, after all the effort to give it back is, also, ridiculous. 

6- you do talk conspiracy, because saying Bibi made 07/10 happen is not proven by anyone, please accept the idea that if a reporter says something, it is not necessary true.",0

Everyone seems to have abandoned their morals in order to do what benefits them most.  


As a Palestinian, I will always defend my people's right to live and right to determination. All of us Palestinians will.

k6yoqtq,"according to wiki, they are not jewish, but rather orthodox  christian, and there is no evidence  whatsoever that they have it, or that this item exists at all outside of biblical fiction

&gt;The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant in Axum. The Ark is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Replicas of the tablets within the Ark, or Tabots, are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and kept in its own holy of holies, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Saint Mary, Saint George and Saint Michael.[101][102]

&gt;The Kebra Nagast is often said to have been composed to legitimise the Solomonic dynasty, which ruled the Ethiopian Empire following its establishment in 1270, but this is not the case. It was originally composed in some other language (Coptic or Greek), then translated into Arabic, and translated into Ge'ez in 1321.[103] It narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by Menelik I with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the Kebra Nagast is the best-known account of this belief, it predates the document. Abu al-Makarim, writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. ""The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant"", he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, ""on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.""[104]

&gt;In his controversial 1992 book The Sign and the Seal, British writer Graham Hancock reports on the Ethiopian belief that the ark spent several years in Egypt before it came to Ethiopia via the Nile River, where it was kept in the islands of Lake Tana for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum.[105] (Archaeologist John Holladay of the University of Toronto called Hancock's theory ""garbage and hogwash""; Edward Ullendorff, a former professor of Ethiopian Studies at the University of London, said he ""wasted a lot of time reading it."") In a 1992 interview, Ullendorff says that he personally examined the ark held within the church in Axum in 1941 while a British Army officer. Describing the ark there, he says, ""They have a wooden box, but it's empty. Middle- to late-medieval construction, when these were fabricated ad hoc.""[106][107]

&gt;*On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, Abune Paulos, said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia.[108] The following day, on 26 June 2009, the patriarch announced that he would not unveil the Ark after all, but that instead he could attest to its current status*.

Then why wasn't olmerts plan accepted? The answer is because not having right of return is a complete non-starter for every iteration of the PA/PLO that has come to the negotiating table. Which is an insane position, unprecedented in international relations. I'll explain what I mean later in this comment.


&gt;Which means Israeli support ""nice settlers"" and dont oppose colonialism. 

My whole argument is that yes, Israelis support nice settlers, but not violent ones. That's the point. That Israelis in general revile bad behaviour. The fact that you consider Jews living in the west bank and example of ""colonialism"" is a wholly separate argument that relies on racist beliefs about Jews. There's absolutely no fundamental reason a non-judenfrei Palestinian state can't exist in the west bank.

&gt;You implied it by explaining that there are also ""nice settlers"".

That wasn't my implication. I'm saying Israelis generally want an end to violence.

&gt;The fact that you use refugees as a tool to defend settlers is disgusting. 

Many ""settlers"" are the exact people in my example. I don't see why it's any more disgusting than using the less than 1% of Palestinians who are actual refugees of Israel to argue for right of return for the other 99% into Israel proper, who have never stepped foot in Israel and have citizenship in other countries. 

I support a right of return for Palestinians into a sovereign Palestine which before October 7th would have included Gaza and the west bank. But it would be ludicrous to advocate for right of return to apply to Israel, which is why I also don't support any additional or expansion of any settlements. I just also oppose any kind of population transfer, because it invariably leads to even more atrocities. Reversing history is always a bad idea.

&gt;We are talking about settlers outside Jerusalem. Jerusalem itself is completly different beast. 

Why? Do most people not consider residents of ma'ale adumim to be settlers? Jewish residents of east Jerusalem? I just used it as an example but I could have easily just said Hebron.

&gt;1. Many settlements are built on stolen or confiscated land left after palestinians fleed

Show me literally one. The whole idea of the west bank is that Palestinians who used to live in what is now Israel proper fled *to* it. Not from it. Jews building settlements in between Arab villages isn't ""building on stolen or confiscated land after Palestinians fleed"".

&gt;2. Israel only wants annexation of Settlements in agreement

You literally raised a counter example of this for me and said I wasn't allowed to use it for... Reasons? Plus, ""annexation of settlements"" could mean anything from one settlement to all of them. And they're usually focused on Jerusalem, which earlier in this very comment you said was a ""different case"".

&gt;Israel still refuses to compensate expulsed Palestinians

If it was a matter of paying Palestinians a few billion dollars to end the conflict, there wouldn't be a conflict in the first place.

I mean the only compensation the PA seems to want is the ""right of return"". If you also believe expelled east Germans had a right to ""return"" to what became Poland, or you believe that occupied Japanese had a ""right to return"" to America, then I'd at least accept you were being consistent. But demanding a ""return"" to a place they never lived in, while the country of their nationality (Palestine) exists, is completely inconsistent with how we understand refugee rights in the rest of the world.",1

k6ynppj,"Hmkay. So just kill ALL PA people? ISRAEL never shouldve take so much land. Israël never shouldve start apartheid. Israël shouldve been thankfull that the PA let them live in PA. But no... they accupied it with violance. So violance they got. Im not pro Hamas or whatever. But the Jews are wrong... this shit began in '48. Thats a fact. I always was kinda pro Israël. But the fact Brittain GAVE the Jews this Land is MINDBLOWING. OFCOURSE the PA peole are saying NOPE. I know, the PA people were resisting at first. But that is NO reason to do what Israel did. Imagine, the USA give a part of Israel to Christian Urkainiers. But, the are taking a bit more land. And a little more. Sometimes using the racist card to everyone who stands up and say something about it. Even the Jews are going to be fed up at one time. Thats logic. I mean, look at what migration is causing in France, Sweden and so on. People dont LIKE it when too much of a other nation is slowly moving in your land. 

I've seen so much gore video's of IDF shooting at kids. Even from the nineties/zeroes. The journalists they killed (sometimes by accident and sometimes not). Let me tell u this: BOTH IDF and Hamas are terrorists. Both should be taken out. Hamas is also controlling the PA people. With blackmailing, violance and brainwashing them. I also believe that this generation of Israël people, is also brainwashed. They only see one sighted news. Propaganda. Etc. So yeah, that is also LOGIC that they hate the Palestines. This hate is thaught. Both parties dehumanise. Otherwise you could not pick up a gun and kill people with so much hate.

Israël made a open prison and occupied illigal land and apartheid. So every born PA is hating them by birth. And when these kids are traumatised and losing their parents because of bombing, its a terrorist in the making IF they dont get counseling and trauma therapy. The proper help can really help children overcome PTSS. BUT these kids dont get that. So, the solution: both parties should stop shooting and end the war. Then the second most important: stop the apartheid. If you want healthy people (mentally) create a save invirement. Make education and work accesible for everyone. This proven to be succesfull. Look at projects at ghettos. Divide the land 40% for the Israël people and the rest to the PA people. But men.... I think its impossible. Because to forgive someone who did so much wrong, is very very very difficult. You must be very strong and see the greater picture. It is easier to be mad. To hate. So, millions of people being alble to do that? I think not. I hope so for both Israël and Palestine. One innocent death,  is one too many.",0

k6yng6s,"1917: The Balfour Declaration (public statement by British to establish a jewish home in Palestine)

1920s: Franco-Syrian War leads to Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. The ensuing emergence of Palestinian nationalism leads to sectarian violence in British Mandatory Palestine. Violence caused by a rebellion against new jewish settlers. 

The Palestinian national movement seeks to form an independent Palestinian state. Jewish national movement is create in response to the violence. More jews move to Israel to bolster their ranks and protect settlements.

Haganah founded in 1920.

1929: Riots lead to 133 jewish deaths and 116 arab deaths. Jews forced to evacuate Hebron and Gaza.

1930s: Arab struggle draws further support from other middle eastern countries. The Black Hand militant group is formed. 

1936 - 1939: Arab Revolt in Palestine orchastrated by the Black Hand. The revolt becomes violent and is repressed by British forces (with assistance from jewish policemen).

The Peel Commission is established and sought to create a partitioning of Palestine. This is rejected by the Palestinian arabs.

The Jewish leaders Chaim Wiezmann and David Ben-Gurion had accepted the proposal.

WW2: the violence in the region calms somewhat to address the global struggle against fascism. Jews and arabs cooperate together with the British to fight the war effort. Some fringe arab groups establish a pro-Nazi propaganda machine, lead by palestinian-arab nationalist Amin Al-Husseini. His cause is driven from Iraq and he is located to Nazi-occupied Europe, where he calls on the Germans to bomb Tel-Aviv.

Holocaust: as the full scale of the horrors of the shoah are discovered, the more jews seek safety in Palestine. Tensions and violent clashes re-emerge as a result. The British attempt to slow the exodus with immigration quotas. Regardless, illegal movement of people continues. 

1947: UN General Assembly recommend adoption of partition into palestinian arab and jewish states. Arab nationalist groups retaliate with violence against the jewish settlers. Arab Liberation Army formed with support from neighouring arab states. 

The jewish settlers are defensive in this conflict. Their forces primarily consist of Haganah and are bolstered by experienced recruits who fought fascism in Europe in WW2. 

The palestinian arabs are pushed back and their lands are claimed by the jewish defenders. Many arabs settlers were told to flee their homes by the liberation arny for the war and never returned. Causing an unimaginable humanitarian refugee crisis.

1948: the State of Israel is formed. Forces from Egypt, (modern) Jordan, Syria, as well as volunteerd from Iraq invade Palestine and begin attacking the jews. They make major gains into the newly-formed nation state. 

The fighting lasts 10 months. 

The IDF is formed as a professional defensive army. 

1949: an armistice agreement is signed defining a partition plan for Israel and Palestine.

1950s: arab militant groups make regular skirmishes into the agreed territory of Israel. 

1956 Suez Crisis: Israel invades Egypt and temporarily hold territory including Gaza, but cede the territory back to Egypt. 

1964: the Palestinian Liberation Organization is formed by Yasser Arafat. 

1967 Six Day War: Egypt build defensive lines along the border. Israel make a pre-emptive attack and destroy Egyptian air force. Israel invades and takes Sinai Peninsula incl. Gaza. Syria shells Israeli positions in the north, but a peace agreement is quickly signed. Israel gains the West Bank from Jordan.

1970: Jordan-Palestine Civil War results in palestinian insurgency spreading to Lebanon. They use Lebanon as a base to continue attacks on Israel. 
This includes the Coastal Road massacre.

1973 The Yom Kippur War: arab coalition launches surprise attack on Israel during its holy day. Israel victory.

1982: palestinians' attempt to murder an Israeli diplomat leads to them taking sides in the Lebanon Civil War. They are successful and Arafat retreats to Tunisia. 

1980s: palestinians begin to rise up against Israeli occupation.

1987: Hamas is formed.

1990s: Israel and Egypt sign a peace treaty. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process leads to the Oslo Accords. These allowed the PLO to move back from their exile in Tunisia. The establish the Palestinian National Authority in West Bank &amp; Gaza. 

The peace process breaks down due to resistance from Hamas militants as well as Israeli domestic terrorists. Yigal Amir assassinates PM Yitzak Rabin. The peace process breaks down. 

2000 - 2005: the 2nd Intafada leads to open combat. PM Ariel Sharon orders all jewish settlers to leave the Gaza strip. Israel formally declares an end to their occupation of Gaza. 

2006: Hamas win the national election and form a government. There will be no further elections in Gaza. 

Israel blockage Gaza with economic sanctions until the militant organisation formally recognizes previous agreements. They do not. There is civil war and Fatah are expelled to the West Bank by Hamas.",1

“International aid has been provided to Palestinians since at least the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Palestinians view the aid as keeping the Israeli–Palestinian peace process going, while Israelis and other foreign policy authorities[1] claim that it is used to fund terrorism[2][3] and removes the imperative to Palestinians to negotiate a settlement of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Palestinian National Authority (PA), within the West Bank and Gaza Strip, receives one of the highest levels of aid in the world.[4] Aid has been provided to the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian non-governmental organizations (PNGOs) as well as Palestinian political factions by various foreign governments, international organizations, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), and charities, besides other sources.

The Ad Hoc Liaison Committee coordinates the delivery of most aid to Palestinians. The entities that provide such aid are categorized into seven groups: the Arab nations, the European Union, the United States, Japan, international institutions (including agencies of the UN system), European countries, and other nations.[5] The United States has been a major donor, providing more than $5.2 billion through USAID since 1994.[6] In July 2018, Australia ceased providing direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, saying the donations could increase the PA's capacity to pay Palestinians convicted of politically motivated violence, and that it will direct its funds through United Nations programs.[7]

The international community has sent billions of dollars in aid to the Gaza Strip to provide relief to the more than 2 million Palestinians living there.[8] From 2014 to 2020, U.N. agencies spent nearly $4.5 billion in Gaza, including $600 million in 2020 alone.[8] According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, aid to Palestinians totaled over $40 billion between 1994 and 2020.[9][10]”

As for the UN 2ss (also supported by PA and PLO) it gives up right of return and any land taken from 1947 and 1948. It also leaves Palestine in 2 broken parts with a corridor secured by israel. And that's ofc the minimum. Any more concessions might be added during real negotiations.",1

Because they were kidnapping and raping (and murdering children in front of the parents, murdering parents in front of the children.  Phoning parents to tell them they were raping their children to death, calling grandmother's on their teenage children's phones and telling them they were murdering them.). Posting videos of murder on the victims social media.

I make it sound atrocious because it was all utterly atrocious.  We saw the videos, we heard the calls.  We saw the utter glee on social media that this was happening over that weekend.  Now we see people claiming it never happened or trying to minimise it.  Pure denialism

&gt;Was there Jewish resistance to Germans? Absolutely. 

Like Hamas, The Nazis wanted to kill Jews *because they are Jews*. This is not the same as the Israeli attitude to the Palestinians.

&gt;Will Jewish fundamentalists accept a Palestinian state?

The majority of Jews would have and probably still would accept a Palestinian state, for an actual peace.  And historically we've had enough weight to overrule the crazies.  

Now I worry that time has passed.  The greatest success of Hamas has been in radicalising Jews so that they don't even want to talk anymore.

What do you mean by that? What ""special strike operation"" you're thinking about? And how do you think it ""avoids casualties""? Do you think other countries have some kind of magic missiles that can target Hamas militants, even when they're hiding in plain clothes within civilian apartments?

If the model here is the international coalition against ISIS, it absolutely destroyed at least two major cities (Mosul and Raqqa), killing many thousands of civilians. The battle of Mosul alone lead to between 6,000 and 40,000 civilian deaths, depending on who you ask. Raqqa, another 2,385. On top of that, you have tens of thousands of ISIS fighter deaths.

But most importantly, we still don't really know the casualties from that campaign. Estimates vary wildly, even though it was several years ago. And nobody even knows or cares about what ISIS claimed.",0

***Alternatives A &amp; B suffer from significant drawback, mainly in terms of their strategic implications and long-term infeasibility. Neither will provide a necessary deterrent or cause a change of mind and may lead within a few years to the same problems and threats that threatened the State of Israel from 2007 until now.

***Alternative C: Evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to Sinai***

*1.	Due to the fight against Hamas, the evacuation of the civilian population from the area of fighting is necessary*

*2.	Israel will work to evacuate the civilian population to the Sinai*

*3.	In the first phase, tent cities will be established in the Sinai. Later a humanitarian corridor will be established to aid the civilian population of Gaza and there will be a construction of cities in the North-Sinai that will be resettled*

*4.	A security zone of several kilometres should be created inside Egypt and the population shouldn’t be allowed to return to the residences near the Israeli border and this will be in addition to creating a security perimeter in our territory near the border of Egypt.*

*Operational steps:*

*1.	Call for the evacuation of the civilian population from the battlefields of where the Hamas attack will take place.*

*2.	In the first phase, operations from the air will be focusing on the northern parts of the Gaza strip in order to allow for a ground operation that will take place in an area that is already evacuated and doesn’t require combat in an area with a high density of civilians.*

*3.	In the second phase, a ground operation will occupy the territory from the North and along the Israeli – Gaza border until the entire strip will be occupied and the underground tunnels will be cleansed from Hamas fighters. This intense ground operation will take less time compared to other alternatives and will therefore allow less time for the chances of opening another Northern front during the fighting within Gaza.*

some would say the Hamas attack was in response to Israel doing XYZ. No, it was a terror attack and one that has received a horrific response. This has been going back and forth for 4,000 years AT LEAST.

That's not to say the subreddit is intellectually challenging : far from it   , it mostly revolves around stating conformation bias  , or parroting statements without fully comprehending their meaning or implications .

Statistics provided by u/badass_panda on the sub  (a  moderator there ) confirm  the majority of the subreddit's subscribers and participants  are mostly Israeli-Jews and thier sympathists  ([roughly 3/5ths](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/ob41kv/results_where_do_you_stand_israel_palestine_peace/)) .

&gt;Did Hamas hide in the orthodox church?

You said yes and linked an article were it says ""Israel’s military acknowledged it had damaged the church site while targeting what it said was a Hamas command center nearby."" As the first thing.... at least read the article yourself.



&gt;I couldnt find any info on that one, pls provide a source

The Jabalia camp is UN established.

As for the jounalists this is what the wiki page you linked says. ""has been affirmed by Israel, but denied by journalists who worked there. Israeli authorities claim that they possess proof supporting their allegations, but have not yet shared any such evidence publicly."" 

So if your proof is ""israel said so and has proof, they just havent shared it for 2 years"" thats not proof.",1

It's important because it impacts the geopolitical landscape. Thailand probably has a lot to say about this.",1
k6ykpwo,"First, I don’t really know what Israel’s plan is. I don’t know what I’d think of its plan if I knew the plan. 

Second, Israel has a right to stop Gaza from attacking it. Gaza still holds a lot of hostages, and Gaza is still firing a lot of rockets at Israel. And, in the real world, countries fight long, brutal wars with much less cause than Israel has. Any international law that says a country can’t respond to continual rocket fire coming from another country is unfair and unrealistic. 

Third, no matter what the international rules or laws are, Israel doesn’t have the right to kill a lot of civilians in Gaza over a long period of time because it’s angry, or because it’s wanting to eliminate the Gazan problem by eliminating the Gazans. 

Aside from questions about morality, that’s not a practical thing to do, because Israel does need trade with Europe and the United States, and Europe and the United States are not going to trade with a small country that goes crazy and kills millions of people. 

Those countries may have done comparable things in the past, but times have changed, and the simple truth is that trade with Arab and Muslim countries is much more important to the world than Israel. If the world really has to choose, and Israel looks mean and crazy, anyway, and maybe worse than Syria, the world will choose to work with the scary crazy people in Syria and Iran over the scary crazy people in Israel. 

And, people could say China. Russia. 

They’re scarier than Israel and, at least in Russia’s case, crazier, but they’re big and important and Israel is small and a rounding error. China and Russia can simply do things that Israel can’t because they’re in a different position.",0

Fatah is strongly affiliated with PLO and they basically recognize the two solution. 

At the end , it's clear that israel is in general on the wrong side of history with their settler colonial ideology and they still favor short term security over a legit two state solution. 


The thing is that the palestinan cause is a very popular cause and probably the entire arab ; muslim world support their rights. History also showed us thst indigenous population almost always get back their rights. You can read about the French in algeria or the whites in South africa. Settler colonialism never work (only if they killed everyone like what the Americans did to red Indians + Australians to aboriginals) 

But in the case of palestine , arabs were able to maintain a strong presence of their population inside the lands ( 2 million in israel, 3.5 million in WB and 2 Millon in gaza) also surrounded by arabs...

So this story is determined towards a palestinan liberation and equal human rights hopefully side by side with israel. (Which is the solution I believe in , the rights of both palestinans and israelis for a county and equal human rights should be maintained for both.)",0

k6ykiak,"&gt;Shift in Global Power Dynamics: The global political landscape has been evolving, with powers like China and Russia asserting themselves more. Hamas might have anticipated that the US would be more preoccupied with these larger geopolitical issues and less likely to focus on the Israel-Hamas conflict.

This genuinely makes zero sense to me. If the USA did nothing to help an ally after this kind of attack nobody would trust them. Israel was always getting American backing, and this is a way to show those powers, none of who currently match the USA, why they shouldn't hit allies.

This usage is erroneous; the compound word antisemitismus (lit. 'antisemitism') was first used in print in Germany in 1879 as a ""scientific-sounding term"" for Judenhass (lit. 'Jew-hatred'), and it has since been used to refer to anti-Jewish sentiment alone.”

Why stop there? Look what the Turks got away with the Armenians and Kurds. 

Only one of these conflicts has resulted in an 80 year display of international left wing sOLiDaRiTY. And what I’m saying is that this obsession with obliterating the State of Israel, this obscene double standard is fundamentally about the fact that the left does not think Jewish lives are of equal value to other lives. That’s ethnic nationalism is acceptable for India, Turkey, Pakistan, and every country in Central/Eastern Europe, but not if it is carried out by Jews in the name of self determination and self defense. That the Jews have to be first in line to renounce their state. Because something something colonialism. 

I have no particular attachment to any political settlement to this conflict in a vacuum, but the obsession of the worldwide left with liberating Palestine—and not one other freedom march is a demonstration of the fundamental emptiness and meaninglessness of it.",1

k6ykb4w,"Its not just that they were there 3500 years ago, its that there were still Jews that remained in Israel over that whole period. Yes, Jews became a minority in the region after the Romans slaughtered and displaced them, but there were still many Jews that stayed. Then, after the Holocaust many Jews moved to the region of Palestine legally, while it wasnt a country and under the jurisdiction of the british. Keep in mind Palestine at this time was more Arab than anything else, and Arabs are relatively new to the region in history. The Jews, who had LIVED THERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS OR HAD LEGALLY MOVED THERE then decided they wanted there to be a legitimate country within the region of Palestine, independent of the British. The British, already stretched thin and getting tired of their colonies was okay with this. IT WAS ONLY THE ARABS COUNTRIES that said no. Then those Jews fought a war with the Arabs to claim their right to have a country, ON LAND THEY ALREADY LIVED ON. The Arabs lost. Then the Arabs fought more wars over the last 100 years, always consistent with the idea that they couldnt accept the idea of a jewish state in the region ON LAND THE JEWS ALREADY OWNED. You are delusional. Read the history or shut up.

Edit: Btw your Roman example is hilarious because Romans are not natives to the regions they conquered, native means you were the first people to settle and create civilizations on the land. Romans just conquered. Matter of fact just like how the Arabs just conquered and thats the only reason why they are in Palestine. Because Arabs arent native to the region but because they raped, pillaged and murdered the actual natives, yall treat them like they are actual natives which is CRAZY. Even Americans all acknowledge they destroyed the Native Americans through conquest. Noone in the US thinks they have Native rights to the land. Arabs just think because of religion they should own Israel. And because of religion they have an ancestral right to it. Well guess who those ancestors were to Islam?

 **there were extremist Jewish groups who didn’t make it easy for them. The state itself allowed them to stay.  This is where the false colonialism claim comes from.

Excuse me, but comparing what happened to Palestinian villages during a war that was waged on Israel, and comparing it to an a surprise attack on civilians that were slaughtered in the most horrific way is cynical at best. And believe me, I acknowledge atrocities that Israel done over the years, and I spoke about it. I almost haven't seen Palestinians talking against what happened in Oct 7.

b. I'm not talking on the security council, i'm talking about the general assembly decision against Hamas. You need 2/3 in order for it to pass, most of the African and all the Arab countries were against condemning Hamas' actions.

c. Well, my dream is to live side by side with the Palestinians. I think that both sides need to understand that no one is going anywhere.

d. Actually the aid so far gets through Rafah to Gaza. I think that Israel best interest is to make sure that there is enough supply that will get to the civilians, and I believe that Israel is not doing enough with trying to guarantee that. That being sad, as I said before, Hamas is terrorizing the population in Gaza unfortunately, and actually benefits from the chaos in Gaza, so it hard to think how to make sure that the supply will get to the humanitarian organizations, but I think that Israel needs to work more towards it.

The biggest question that should be asked at this point is how far does Israel take it? Me personally I would exterminate all of them. Not because I’m some ruthless being but because these areas like Gaza and West Bank have proven time and time again they can never be civil. They have so much hate for the people of Israel, they are willing to risk their own lives to end the lives of the people they hate.

Are we talking about the same “innocent” people who teach their youth in educational facilities at a young age to hate their neighbors and wish death upon them?

From the reports I’ve read, there’s no love lost in Thailand for Hamas, and much comparison to their own struggles with Islamist insurgency in the south of their country. However, the Thai people are also quite angry with Israel, for doing too little to protect their Thai guest workers and keep them out of harm’s way. Israeli tourists — most of them young, full of testosterone and bravado, and fresh out of their IDF service — already have a reputation in Thailand for being rude and demanding to the locals. Now, diplomatic tensions between Israel and Thailand are becoming quite strained. I see far, *far* fewer Thais signing up to be guest workers in Israel, and I see Israeli tourists facing a much frostier reception in Thailand, at least for the short term future.

In Korea, the televised execution of a Korean hostage by ISIS a few years back outraged the Korean public. Before that, most Koreans were wholly indifferent to Islam and Muslim foreigners in Korea.

As I understand it, Palestine was pretty sparsely populated until Zionist immigrants started arriving in the late 19th and early 20th century. They bought land, started building up communities, founded schools, set up industries for trade. This increase in prosperity attracted more immigrants, both Zionist and Arab. At that point it became 'a melting pot'. Naturally this also created tensions between the various religions and ethnicities.

&gt;The Palestinians, who had lived in peace and harmony for generations

This is a modern re-writing of history. There was no Palestinian 'identity' until the 20th century. Today's Palestinians are mostly the descendants of Arab immigrants who arrived in the same decades as the Zionists, and their modern nationalist identity was formed explicitly from conflict: in opposition to the British who ruled Palestine, and then to the Zionists when they tried to establish their state.

k6yia1n,"&gt;The IDF may not be targeting civilians ""on purpose"" — debatable, they have been caught doing so in the past many times, including journalists and activists and children

It's very much not debatable, and they haven't been caught targeting journalists, activists or children, unless you believe in the world that Al-Jazeera propaganda wants to produce.

I've served in the British Army as an Officer in the Infantry for most of my career.

I taught Law of Armed Conflict to everything from soldiers to Officers for a large portion of this, have been directly involved in two conflicts, and indirectly involved in another three, including Afghanistan and Iraq.

But never in my career working with NATO allies have I seen them use this level of surgical weapons, and warn civilians of attacks so thoroughly, sometimes even phoning civilians beforehand, which gives Hamas a huge advantage.

It's no secret that Hamas uses an extensive tunnel system dug deliberately under civilian areas, and there is an encyclopedia worth of evidence of them dressing soldiers as civilians, hiding rockets and other weapons among schools, hospitals and mosques, and basically every other Isis-style tactic aimed to get their own civilians in harms way.

There was a large study across NATO about the 2014 war in Gaza, and how it was a golden standard of how to prevent civilian casualties in such a built up and asymmetric environment.

The number of [civilian casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio) caused by the IDF, both in sheer number and in proportionality to combatants, is very very low compared to individual operations within Afghanistan, Iraq, or virtually any other war you choose.

If there were any indication that they targeted civilians on purpose, believe me that I would be the first to oppose them.

And presumably it was fine for the Nazis to occupy France and Austria? And for the Europeans to occupy Africa and South America? All fine because they had the capability?

&gt;You sound like the type of guy who wouldn’t believe a sexual assault victim unless you watched them be assaulted… Weird choice but ok. 

Please, name the victim. Show me the first hand testimony. Accusations need to be credible.

&gt;Israel’s government has lied in the past yes… There is no reason they’d lie about this current war

They have the exact same reasons now that they have always had.

&gt;they’re losing billions of dollars and support around the world. 

They have lost no money, and in fact the US is increasing their financial support. They are losing support around the world, but only from ordinary people. They still have unequivocal support from governments and the mainstream media. Materially they are losing nothing (for now).

&gt;Overall, I think you’re in denial about how evil Islamic terror is… Everything Hamas did in the Oct 7 attack is inline with what Islamic terrorists do around the Middle East. It’s naive to think otherwise

But you don't actually know what they did. You're incapable of finding evidence to support any of what you think happened.

&gt;Why you’ve chosen to defend Islamic terrorism is beyond me… maybe Edgelording, maybe naivety and misplaced empathy.

I'm not defending anything, I'm supporting liberation and asking for evidence when accusations are made.

&gt;Parading naked bodies (Alive or unconscious) around the town square while regular civilians cheer? That’s a special type of degeneration

Like I said, I didn't like that video and I don't condone that behaviour. But this goes back to the requirement for perfect victims. These people have known nothing but violence and humiliation for their entire lives. It is just chauvinistic to sit here from the comfort and safety of the west and shake our finger when these people who are fighting and dying for liberation and self determination don't act exactly as we would like.

Also, if she is alive as her mother says she is, that would mean that she was in that truck to be driven to receive medical attention. Context is important.

&gt;IDF soldiers pissing on dead Palestinians is terrible. They should be persecuted

And do you think they will be?

&gt;The more Palestinians think like you and pursue armed resistance… The more their quality of life will be reduced

Again, would you say this about the Algerians kicking out the French? The Vietnamese? The Haitians? The Ukrainians? 

Why does anyone fight back? Should all oppressed people just accept their fate?

&gt;You also don’t seem to accept the level of hatred from Muslims towards Jews… Proceeding this conflict by over 1000 years. They aren’t fighting for freedom dude, it’s a murderous death cult

Yet not only then, as you say, but even more so now, the indiscriminate killing of German civilians, and even moreso the two atomic bombs — which unleashed not the fires of hell but a deeper horror still — dropped onto innocent Japanese, really ought to be considered war crimes by the Geneva Conventions.

The IDF may not be targeting civilians ""on purpose"" — debatable, they have been caught doing so in the past many times, including journalists and activists and children — but, at the minimum, they evidently don't care if civilians die, as evidenced by the enormous amount of bombs dropped — amounting to a quarter of an atomic bomb in TNT explosive energy — and the extremely high death counts for women, children and the elderly in Gaza that the IDF knew would result.

I wrote [a whole post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/17e1fcl/no_israeli_mothers_dont_cry_harder_than/) on why that argument is wholly immoral and illegal, according to any modern system of morality and law, including international law. and the morality the Palestinians apply to themselves.

As for the last part: let's assume for a moment the IDF soldiers commit Black Shabbat-level crimes against humanity in Gaza, keeping to the same death toll. Kidnapping, raping, and murdering people in a concert, purely because they're Palestinian. Breaking into multiple homes, slowly torturing children in front of their parents, removing eyes, fingers, feet from children and parents, and then tying children and parents together and slowly burning them alive. Disappearing 200 random civilians, including babies and grandmas for ransom, and using them as human shields for IDF operations.

Do you think that at that point, you'd just treat it as just more 1000 deaths out of 3000, 8000, or whatever Hamas is claiming right now? That ultimately, a dead baby is a dead baby, and torturing a baby to death is morally the same as killing him in a crossfire with terrorists that hid in his building? Of course not. There's a reason why Palestinians and pro-Palestinians remember, to this day, the atrocities of Deir Yassin, the murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, the arson of Duma, and not the more mundane, more numerous Palestinian deaths that happened that year.

k6yge0j,"It seems like you're a child or you have a thinking capacity of a child, so after your last reply I can see that you have no idea about what you're talking about. I'll clear some points since you're uneducated about the matter.

1- I'm against the call to death of Jews just for being Jews, but It's fine calling the death upon one's oppressor, aka the Zionist. Being a jew is different than being a Zionist, check all the Pro-Palestinian / Anti-Zionist Jews.

2- Colonialist states and UN controlled by colonialist States that themselves are anti-semetic, created Israel to kick out Jews from Europe and buy their Allegiance and to have a strong hold in a strategic area of the world. The establishment of countries is usually done by majority of people living in them, not like Israel where the country was formed by colonialist states that armed militias to kick out the indigenous people and import the population. That's a colonialist abomination of a state.

3- ""What happened before doesn't matter"". To you it doesn't cause the founding of Israel was a war crime, for many following up on the current situation, the history started on October 7. What happened was a reaction, and as the UN chief called it, ""it didn't happen out of vacuum"", it's a reaction and retaliation for years of oppression, occupation, and humiliation. 

4- ""Calling civilians to leave (to where)"", let Israelis go back home to Europe, just by a random survey of the hostages with Hamas you can see that most of them are double passport holders of Israeli and European passports. They can go back to their own countries or their ancestral countries. To Europe, US, Russia, and other countries.

5- It's a very stupid question to ask where European money was going pre Hamas, if you're referring to the European Union it was founded in 1992. If you're referring to any medical aid or food aid, it went for that. You think medical and food aid was the initial funding of Hamas, was that what you were aiming at?

I haven't denied the fact that the Arabs lost the war.
I haven't denied that because of them losing, a lot of misfortune happened to them.
But - you cannot deny that it was their choice to start the war, and the faith of the Jews was far worse if the Arabs would have won.
The Arabs armies promised them that if they would leave their houses, they would get those houses back after the Arab armies will kill all the Jews, and the local Arabs believed them.

Also, you are forgetting that the Jewish population of those Arab countries was extinct. Most of them fled to Israel ( my grandfather was born in Syria, and escaped it just before the Syrian Arabs would have killed his family, my father is from Tunisia, and his family fled the German Nazis).



And if you didn't know, the Arabs attacked the Jews constantly even before the formation of Israel as well as during the Independence war; see here;

k6ydtdd,"It’s a very good question and I’m sorry you’re getting a lot of knee-jerk responses. We’re all on edge. 

I’m of two minds on the supply cutoff. It serves a few purposes: in any other situation, the fact that Israel supplies Gaza with everything it needs to function SHOULD mean we have the leverage to deter violence and force them to negotiate towards peace. However, as we were just discussing on the other sub, the concept of ‘military superiority/nuclear capacity/supply monopoly’ as deterrence and leverage only works under 2 conditions: 

1. They believe that you will actually use this, and do not “call your bluff”
2. They care

We can only attack the first one: in essence, they called our bluff, perhaps believing that we wouldn’t respond so strongly in response to international pressure. We have to show them that it’s not a bluff. 

The Palestinians are responsible for the second. We can’t make them blame Hamas directly: we can only continue to respond negatively to bad actions with enough consistency that eventually they will make the connection between firing on us and getting fired upon, and connect that to Hamas, who does the firing. 

On the other hand, I see your point that there may be minimal direct tactical consequences for Hamas. It is horrible to know that there are people who don’t support Hamas who are now suffering for its actions. However, that is the case when any government decides to go to war; the people suffer. Innocent Russians have suffered massively from Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. They’ve seen their friends and family conscripted and used as cannon fodder. They’ve further lost their freedoms or been forced to flee their homes, perhaps never to return. This is what war is: powerful people decide to set in motion things that will inevitably kill innocent people who didn’t sign up for that. 

I don’t know why more supplies aren’t getting through the Rafah crossing. I don’t know why the Gazans thought that their total reliance on us, and simultaneous war with us, was smart to begin with. This war is so tactically insane and irrational that I can barely even offer commentary on it. It’s almost as though their strategy is to do the stupidest and most insane things possible in the knowledge that some people will seek to invent justifications for those actions and even use it as proof of their underlying convictions against Israel: “see, look at them acting crazy, you drove them insane! _Look what you made them do!_”",0

Lastly not a vetted reason but my understanding: Islamic brothers fighting is okay because they are fighting within the family, Jews and muslim fighting is bad because Jews need to be held to a higher standard, without acknowledging that they do have higher standards",0

Palestine and Israel were on the verge of peace talks many times only for them to be scuttled by the assassination of Arafat as well as Rabin and other circumstances. Even if past efforts have failed, even if it were true the Palestinians rejected it previously, does not stop or negate our responsibility to establish one, because it is the only way to stop the violence.

If you're asking this question, than you're deeply missing some fundamental features of government. The job of the government is to look after the interests it's own people. The Israeli people vote for their government and not for any other government. Because no other government in the world has the responsibility to look after Israelis, the Israeli government must put it's own citizens above all others. 

If the decisions is one dead Israeli dies vs 1000 dead Palestinians, it's the duty of the government to save the 1 Israeli. Obviously morally this is problematic, but this is what makes the Hamas attack so fucking horrible. Israel has no choice but to do this. They can, and likely will try to reduce collateral damage, but Hamas sealed the fate of countless innocent Palestinian lives with their act.

k6yczrp,"- If you wanna do a human cost for thus conflict ...palestinans have been killed way way more than israelis ( due to US, eurpean weapons and support). 


- PLO has recognized israel since the 70s. They got nothing but settlements and apartheid. 

-Everytime israel offers a state for palestinans it is with total control over their water, energy , borders and airspace. That state can never do deals with any country unless they get agreement from israel. No dignified human being can accept a formalised form of oppression. 

What is more, east Jerusalem was never part of any offer from israel (which contains the whole core of the palestinan identity , al - aqsa mousqe) . The best plan was ehud barak he offered the ability to ""visit"" al aqsa mousqe but it will be under israeli border.

That's why the palestinans never accepted these ""offers"". (BTW, just for the record, PLO agreed to be a demilitarised country). 

- Regarding Oslo, the PLO followed the plan literally. It's israel that is still building settlements on area B, and area C (around 70% of west bank ) ...technically israel killed the 2 state solution. West bank now looks like Swiss cheese with 0 chance to make a functional country there.

-regarding history , indeed there was no ""major"" massacre incident before the 20s. 

What happened is that the arab educated elite became aware of the zionist project that was developed in Hungary. They pointed out to this danger. 

What is more, in 1916 the arabs helped the British empire to remove the Ottoman empire in exchange thry were promised paleatine , levant and arabia but they were simply used by the British colonial powers. The British did the balfour declaration in 1917 promising Jews a country in palestine (without any respect to their promise for arabs).",0

One of the audio recordings I recently heard was a Hamas terrorist who called his parents from the phone of a woman he killed.  He called to brag to them and receive praise.  It leaves me wondering if his parents are typical of what we refer to as innocent Palestinians.  

As far as half the population being children, the number I've been hearing is 40% btw, much of that group is still of fighting age and would have to take part in any such resistance.  If they're old enough to fight for Hamas, they're old enough to resist.

I feel confident the 9th largest army in the world can disarm Hamas or whoever *after* a peace treaty. I don't think Egypt can be helpful in disarming the WB settlers (not least of which because we don't have a land border but there are 100 other reasons :p)

I also think this will need to be a multi-year or for some parts multi-decade and tiered process. I doubt that even as rational and peace loving as we may be today, asking my parents generation (whose parents may have been killed, missing, or injured by the IDF) to automatically be friends with Israelis in 1982 would have taken a while. It takes some hard choices and sacrifices, a full generation to simmer, and then you can get people like me imho.

The Palestinians hate their oppressors. They are currently being oppressed and humiliated. I get it. But just like there were the Black Panthers and Malcom X on one side and MLK on the other, this isn't meant to be a forever hatred. Very few Black people today just *hate* white devils or whatever.

I don't think arguing that the Mandatory Power (British) that was the colonizer and illegitimately ""owned"" land Palestinians had been living and working on for hundreds of years is the winning argument you seem to think it is.

That's the whole point of why this is wrong! Here's land the Ottomans took over from largely the ancestors of those same Palestinians and taxed but allowed Palestinians to continue to live on, and suddenly it belongs to the British Colonial power who, instead of handing it over to the people it naturally belongs to, created the circumstances to more or less eventually have it go to Israel.

Consequently, the PA had to rely on domestic resources to finance its needs and has also been paying partial salaries since November 2021.

Economic growth and the PA’s revenues remain below potential due to movement and access restrictions, including in Area C. Palestinian external trade is controlled by Israel and is subject to costly non-tariff barriers that have reduced competitiveness. Furthermore, the Israeli closures on Gaza has resulted in an almost completely closed economy. The fiscal deficit (before aid) is expected to remain large in 2022 at 5.1% of GDP. ""

He further shared that Israel has denied Palestinians access to their natural resources, including shared water resources and an estimated 1.5 billion barrels of oil reserves in the West Bank as well as more than $2.5 billion worth of natural gas off the Gaza coast.  “Israel’s system of policies and practices has systematically stripped the Palestinian economy of vital elements for its healthy operation, whose productive base continues to shrink, thereby exacerbating dire living conditions,” he emphasized.  The Syrian Golan has also suffered from discriminatory policies regarding land, water and zoning, he added.

The observer for the State of Palestine, noting that over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza continue to suffer from the illegal blockade, deepening poverty and unemployment, stressed that Israel continues to allow “terrorist settlers” to kill her people in plain sight, destroying their homes and attacking their agricultural land, fruit and olive trees.  Ending the illegal occupation is key to ending the suffering of the Palestinians so they can achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, she stated, further urging the international community to fulfil its legal obligations to end the apartheid regime.""

k6yagay,"‘UN Secretary-General António Guterres rightly said that the most recent violence “grows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year-long occupation and no political end in sight.” Various UN officials and investigative mechanisms have reaffirmed for years that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory – the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza – has been ongoing since 1967 and has no legal validity. Throughout Israel and the occupied territory, the Israeli government has imposed a two-tiered legal and political system of systematic discrimination and oppression to maintain the domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. Experts and human rights groups have recognized that this system satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for apartheid, a crime against humanity.’

‘Israeli authorities and security forces consistently employ violence and inhumane acts targeting Palestinians, including arbitrary and extrajudicial killings, torture, the denial of fundamental rights and collective punishment. In Gaza, Israel has imposed a total blockade by air, land and sea since 2007, inflicting an ongoing humanitarian crisis on 2.3 million Palestinians living in what many have characterized as the world’s largest “open-air prison.” In the Occupied West Bank, illegal settlement expansion has escalated. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 789 Palestinian-owned structures have already been demolished or seized by Israeli government authorities so far in 2023. In recent years, plans for thousands of housing units have been advanced to expedite settlement expansion, effectively guaranteeing that the occupied territory will remain under Israeli control in perpetuity. Under the Geneva Conventions, settlement expansion is a war crime.’

Iran is desperate to become a nuclear power aligned with Russia, China and North Korea (FWTW). Israel will always be a hindrance to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, thus the hatred. The Palestinians are the pawns in the game to manipulate the West and a constant source of terrorists and violence. Authoritarianism is the rule in the Middle East because there isn’t a real grasp of democracy or freedom and whenever there is, the extremists show up to turn over the apple cart.

Lol.

Western media doesn't care if Turkey is secular or theocratic. They only care if Turkey is working for American interests or not. Back in the days, western media used to regard Kemalists as ""Islamophobes"", who oppressed religion and Erdoğan as a great muslim liberator, an example to rest of muslim world. Of course he was subservient to the West in this period. Erdoğan was given as example as how leadership in the rest of Muslim world should be. American media was even pushing the idea of Turkey finally joining the EU.

Turkey's negative coverage started when Erdoğan's policies started to drift away from American interests. Particularly with the war against Gulenists (CIA project) and involvement in Syria. Nothing to do with his internal policies at all.

Even today, Western media determined the ""heroes"" fighting against Erdoğan's backward government to be, liberals and leftists. They are the ones covered primarily in Westen media, despite being a tiny demographic. (Also pro-PKK Kurds) While Kemalists who are actually the main opposition to Erdoğan never have their voices heard in Western media.

This is the demographic America wants to see ruling Turkey post-Erdoğan, as they're most likely to be subservient. They receive enormous amounts of funds from Western NGOs.

Of course, no backing came after the first, second or third attack on Israel.

k6y8b1t,"Not every comment needs to bring up the entire context, but had I felt the need to do so, it would have gone back to the beginning and included the fact that the Jewish people have been in that area for millennia, before the so-called Palestinians.  When they returned to their homeland, there was opportunity for peace.  Right up until the Arabs attacked (Again and again and again).  In fact, there continue to be opportunities for peace.  Such as the peace talks that the Hamas attacks interrupted, the Abraham Accords.

Hamas doesn't want peace, Hamas simply wants the territory, and I'd argue if they achieve that goal, they won't stop, they'll continue on to eradicate all Jews, just like was called for in their original charter.

Palestine voted Hamas into office.  I'll give you that rising up is risky, but not rising up is also risky.  That is a standard, BTW, I hold all people to.  Keep your government in check so another nation doesn't need to.

IDF kills civilians too. But they do so because Hamas are purposefully setting up their military assets in areas that will cause the most collateral damage.

Most people aren't just wanting to live on their land. After Palestinians separated from Egypt, Jordan, Syria etc and made their own governments, the Oslo agreements were meant as a route towards statehood, and the Israelis were happy for that. 

The problem was there was (and still is) widespread support, especially among the young, to use violence against civilians to push negotiations. Fatah, and probably Hamas more recently, believed that they could use violence to get better concessions from Israel, and that that was the only language they understood. So, they killed civilians, built up arms, and prepared for war.

Israelis saw that as Palestinians preparing to invade Israel, and used force to stop them and escalated control of them to stop terrorism.

IDF dosnt have the military capability to carpet bomb

&gt;No matter how much you try to justify it the fact remains that the IDF is killing innocent civilians 100x more than they are killing Hamas

False. Hamas reported 8k dead people in Gaza since the start of the war. Assuming the numbers arent fake (as we learned in the hospital bombing incident), and assuming theyre all civilians and not at all Hamas terrorist, its still only less than 6 time more than Israeli casualties. Nevertheless dont expect eye-for-eye as this war target is to elliminate Hamas and defend Israel, from all sides, no matter what it takes.

&gt;Leveling an entire Apartment complex because 1 Hamas agent is hiding in it is not a justification.

Yes it is. And in addition, Israel have been warning Gazans for weeks to gtfo south

&gt;If they truly wanted to eliminate Hamas while not committing war crimes they would go in boots on the ground. But since the IDF is made up of cowards not soldiers they will never do that.

Who are you little turd to decide how an army should win in war? Additionally to your bullshit, all states are against Israel making ground moves so stop the hypocrisy. And even then, no kne will dictate to another nation''s army of to defend itself, thus Israel is making ground moves, contradicting your statement.

&gt;Warfare involves soldiers fighting against soldiers

Wow I didnt know Israeli babies, children and elders among other civilians qualified as soldiers and theyre ok to be targeted

&gt;That is not a war

Yes it is, again you make stupid declerations.
Israel will win for the sake of its existance



&gt;I have seen hundreds of video's of dead children being pulled from the rubble but I have yet to see a single Hamas soldier be killed in these attacks,

1. All the child videos you see are probably Pallywood. Just like the girl who been rescued 3 times, the corpse playing a mobile phone between sets and many other fakes.
2. Look at IDF publications for Hamas leaders death list

&gt;Was Hamas hiding in the church? Were they hiding in the Hospital? Are they hiding in the children's school?

Yes, yes and yes

&gt;To my knowledge Hamas has never done anything of the sort but the IDF has done this dozens of times. 

Yea we understood your knowledge is extremly lacking.

&gt;The IDF intentionally targets children because children represent the future of the Palestinian people

Hamas uses them as human shields. Even UNRWA confirmed that

&gt;Did Hamas ever bomb a hospital?

3 times in this war actually: 2 time an Israeli one and 1 time Gazan one if you count PIJ and Hamas together

&gt;Did the IDF? Yes

Not yet, but since IDF published intel reveling Shifaa hospital is Hamas quarters, they warned the hospital the evacuate an I assume they will begin exterminating the facilities

&gt;It seems to me that this ""response"" is way too far coming from the Israeli si

Who are you to decide how a country defend itself? The threat will be removed, this is the war goal.

&gt;Hamas fired a few home made rockets made out of water pipes so that gives Israel the right to use million dollar munitions, gifted by the most powerful country in the world to level an entire block

Basically writing off the entire New History community as ""Hamas apologists"". What a truly bizarre statement.

\&gt;he only ethnic cleansing the Israeli government committed in recent times

\&gt;recent times

....right...I guess there is some kind of timer on how long it takes until decades of ethnic cleansings are no longer relevant to a people. Hmm interesting. I'll uhh meditate on that one. It's not like 2023 had the most Palestinian casualties from Israel aggression since 2005 or earlier IIRC.

\&gt;Building materials are being diverted to be used for Hamas tunnels. That's why Israel is limiting the influx of materials. There are several cement factories in Gaza however.

That doesn't change how your average Palestinian lives on a day to day basis. [They literally have to work in half destroyed factories](https://youtu.be/hw4CH-Jg6lY?t=193) to keep themselves going. That is, if they are amongst the minority of people lucky enough to have a job.

\&gt;Hamas themselves outlawed the digging of new wells and dug up water pipes to create rockets.

That is such a disingenuous representation of historical fact you cannot actually be serious.

""The legacy of Israel’s 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories has been systematic human rights violations on a mass scale. One of its most devastating consequences is the impact of Israel’s discriminatory policies on Palestinians’ access to adequate supplies of clean and safe water.

Soon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 50 years on, Israel continues to control and restrict Palestinian access to water in the OPT to a level which neither meets their needs nor constitutes a fair distribution of shared water resources.

In November 1967 the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158, which stated that Palestinians could not construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. Since then, the extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure would require permits from Israel, which are near impossible to obtain. Palestinians living under Israel’s military occupation continue to suffer the devastating consequences of this order until today. They are unable to drill new water wells, install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and fresh water springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry.""

\- from [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)

Why don't you explain WHY Hamas banned the free drilling of wells? Because their underground aquifier was being contaminated. They didn't ban it btw, they started licensing it, because people could freely dig wells without regulation and it was making the groundwater undrinkable, as well as they were facing a groundwater deficit. They have a very limited supply of water, thanks to Israeli oppression, so it needs to be regulated.

There are definitely legitimate concerns about how that money will be used be a clearly corrupt group like Hamas. But the bottom line is this problem exists because of decades of water insecurity as imposed by Israel.

There is good reason why there are literally people who study the Holocaust for a career [calling out Israel's actions as genocidal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWGGjLZNuyg&amp;t=332s&amp;ab_channel=DemocracyNow%21)",1

[Hamas has asked for a trade](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjv5rrqz6) of all Israeli hostages for all Palestinian ""prisoners"" (many effectively hostages: held for decades without trial). If Israel accepted that trade, [as the families of the hostages want](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-28/ty-article/.premium/hostages-families-tell-netanyahu-releasing-palestinian-prisoners-is-only-option/0000018b-77b0-d1da-a1bb-7fb80e600000), it would do quite a bit to calm the situation both there and internationally. 

Then Israel could signal to the Palestinian Authority a renewed interest and need for peace negotiations. The UN could oversee these talks and eventually oversee the process for a two-state solution. Gaza would be absorbed into this new nation and Hamas, as an ideology, would lose support.

Personally I tend to divide this issue into 2 parts because it is quite complex:

1.  Government dealing with the occupation. (first a little reminder that only the WB is occupied, Gaza is an independent territory thet relies on Israel and I'll get back to that later.)

So there is a current military occupation in the west bank. for them, it means that they have their own governing body but cannot have an army. While I do understand Israel's decision to do this, I think that the Idf often take it too far and often use too much violence (those are most of the stories you read on that site). This is what me and the majority of the left wing are against!!!

we believe that a left wing government can avoid the useless violence and work to quiet down the area until there can be proper conversations about peace and a Palestinian state. we want to stop that violence!!!

(but anyone who says that the occupation should immediately leave- does not understand the situation, because right now the years of violence have led the WB to a point where they WILL try to destroy Israel instead of living peacefully beside it. Both countries need some peaceful cool-down tome beforehand.)

2. Israel protecting itself.

as I've stated before, while there is too much violence and silencing on the WB, and that can be dealt with,

Gaza is a completely different story. They're an independent territory: Israel does NOT enter that territory on a regular basis, and therefore they do not use violence or silencing. during ""peacetime"" Israel actually helps Gaza by providing them with electricity and water,

yet somehow the Gazan citizens still scream occupation, so in this situation I (and the majority of the left wing) support Israel and its defence.",1

Not only this, *even if* the comparison were appropriate (if America had colonized Japan, made them into second-class citizens and annexed some of the land as they tried to resist) and then the Japanese found a way to be okay with it, that would still just be Japan's choice. 

It wouldn't take anything away from the Palestinians' right to resist. If someone comes and robs my house, my innate reaction would be to run out the back door. In that scenario, nobody gets hurt. But if someone chooses to stand their ground and beat up the intruder, that reaction is valid too, and it doesn't give the intruder the right to pull out a gun and shoot the homeowner. 

And then try to spin a narrative about how they're the victim because the homeowner attacked them as they were committing a felony. 

The reclamation of their land was not the only platform Hamas ran on. They promised schools and a level of economic prosperity to the people. Second, it's 100% valid for them to elect a party whose intention is to resist the occupation of their land.

Stop listening to warmongers on the internet considering they do not have to actually go through this war like us. It’s okay to be mad about what happened, but be understanding as well and look at the WHY this is happening. And I know the warmongers will say “BUT HAMAS IS WHY ITS HAPPENING”. Hamas is a result of Israeli government and their actions.

What we need to do, for the safety of everyone over there, is eliminate the NEED for hamas. Because all these guys think destroying an area with 2 million people will fix everything, when historically you just piss more people off and create more terror.

If Gaza is leveled, the entire Middle East will become hostile to you. The Middle East will put heavy sanctions on you. And Americans military is not what it used to be post Iraq war, despite what these guys will tell you. The US can’t protect you guys forever, and TBH most people here don’t want to be over there at all.

It’s better for everyone if the international community steps in, forces Bibi and his friends to resign. And ends this. Or else there will be no Israel. America simply cannot win against the entire Middle East, Russia, and China.

We are all feeling loss right now. And we are all angry. We need to do what Rabin was doing before a far right Benjamin Netanyahu supporter killed him.

And don’t listen to anyone who doesn’t have anything invested over there. These guys who suggest war can watch it from their phones and sleep soundly at night. They aren’t going to be losing their homes and families if this turns out bad.

Lastly, you can definitely recognize a government's faults while still appreciating one's culture and traditions. It's not hard to grasp

There are a lot of genuine good reasons to stand for Israel, besides the selfish ones of ""I live here"". There are legal, historical and moral justification for the existence of Israel. There is also a religious justification but I don't care about it and online trolls use that as a strawman to argue Israel shouldn't exist so why give them the opportunity.

I don't want Gaza to be bombed either nor do I want innocent Palestinians dead. Unfortunately, I recognize Hamas uses them as human shields to push its narrative and it is literally inevitable, even when tremendous effort is made to avoid it, to not harm civilians in a process of eliminating Hamas.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Even expressing that opinion in Israel is a hot take. A lot of my friends who were leftists are calling for destruction of Gaza since 10/7.

I, nor any of my leftist friends, agree with you that it's a ""hot take"". It's a genuine humane 'take' and I don't know anyone who would doubt it or argue with you about it. Emotions are running high but I don't know anyone who thinks that Palestinians don't deserve to live or that they're all terrorists, end of discussion. I acknowledge that might be thanks to my environment, so lets look at the media- Not one media channel in Israel considers all Palestinians terrorists, nor does anyone call for their destruction.

&gt;Doing “hasbara” online feels pointless since the majority is pro Palestine, and for some of their points I don’t have answers. I’m convinced IDF has done evil things. But when I see them justifying the events of 10/7, I’m furious. The way they somehow justify the party massacre, when it could’ve been me getting slaughtered.

I'm not denying the IDF has committed what can be described as war crimes, yet calling an entire organization, made up of Israelis like you and me, evil? That's idiotic to say the least. If you're actually an Israeli who has served in the IDF, you should know better.Doing ""hasbara"" online feels like an uphill battle but the only reason people are so pro Palestinian is because for decades Israel has put zero effort in presenting its side of the story to the world.

An Egyptian can feel Arab and still have an affinity with the country's Pharaonic past. An Arabic-speaking Assyrian or Kurd can be proud of his sect and heritage AND consider the Arabic language to be a huge part of their identity. Reality doesn't conform to intellectuals' ideas and ideals. 

As for Israeli hasbara, of course they'd utter phrases like that. ""There's 22 Arab countries, why can't the Palestinians just relocate?""  The presence of 22 Arab political entities doesn't give a group of nativist, militant Jews the right to uproot non-Jewish people (Palestinians in this case) and expel them. It doesn't give them the right to steal houses and farmland. The problem isn't Arab nationalism, it's mostly the fact that a certain group of Jews can be shamelessly nativist and far right without the international community really calling them out on it.

They also constantly kept coming back to it, even when it was occupied by other powers. Being Semitic has nothing to do with anything. If you want to get recent, they were there in the 1800s and early 1900s. They were always there. The Arabs were nomads, they were never a unified people. The term Palestinian only came into existence in the ‘60s. It’s not even an Arabic word. The Romans gave it to the locals. When the land was ruled by the British, they partitioned it, and gave the Arabs a part of it. THEY REFUSED! Why do all the pro Palestinians conveniently overlook this fact? They were even given a part of Jerusalem! And they refused! You say you’re not antisemitic. But do you not understand what is at the heart of the matter? They want the annihilation of Israel! How is that okay? They were offered a two state solution over and over again. If you’re going to fight someone, you have to be prepared to lose, and against all odds, the Arab nations did lose. Why do you also not see the need for a buffer between Israel and its enemies? In North America, you simply put up a fence between you and your neighbor and you consider that a buffer. But I’d like to know what kind of buffer you would consider acceptable if that neighbor threw a bomb into your backyard. All Israel ever wanted was peace. You seem to conveniently forget that they walked the talk with Egypt a long time ago. Once Sadat recognized Israel’s right to exist, Israel immediately gave them back the Sinai. What exactly are you looking for here? For them to stop the bombing and let Hamas continue unchecked? Are you looking for proportionality?

The fact that you use refugees as a tool to defend settlers is disgusting.

Do you support right to return?

1. Many settlements are built on stolen or confiscated land left after palestinians fleed

Social media has caused news of the conflict to reach a much broader range of people, too, while pushing short, sensationalized content. It's created a shitstorm of half baked hot takes instead of real information.",1
k6y4agr,"No Israeli authenticated or goverment-funded force as been actively targeting, hurting and hunting down innocent civilians as much as hamas does on both sides and that is just a fact. Israel has encountered and dismantled numerous terrorist organizations over the years, whether these are secretly or publicly commited organizations, while keeping civilian casualties as low as possible, respective of their causes. Tell me this: why is the Hamas blantly trying to get their civilians to stay in area Israeli forces tell them to evacuate, despite knowing the great danger they're putting them in, instead of using their resources (which they steal from 3rd-party-founded programs made to specifically help their citizens have a better living quality) to help evacuate those in danger? Because these people are their political meat shield. Those in power, in the charge of the Hamas don't see them as people, they see them as political power, that's why.",1

2. I'm guessing that you are suggesting that there were victims of friendly fire - this sort of information becomes public after a probe post war. This was the case in all recent wars, post Yom Kippur. During the fighting little criticism is voiced, but after - the truth (or most of it) will come out. So just like we had the Winograd Commission, Kahan Commission and the Agranat Commission, I hope we'll know the truth with a Commission here as well.

Being unsophisticated, uneducated, etc., and relying on what are certainly racist chants doesn't mean the *CORE* and *source* of the Palestinian stance is antisemitic. 

It is inconceivable to look at this situation and say, the real reason Palestinians hate Israelis is that they're antisemitic. It's far, far more likely they hate Israelis because they've been brutally colonized, oppressed, dehumanized and murdered by them. 

When we look at how muted the Palestinian response to demographic engineering of Palestine was via the Mandate for Palestine, we understand it's very unlikely that antisemitism is the core of their problem with Israelis. 

The main issue is that the establishment of Israel and Israelis has been nothing but a complete catastrophe for them. Their responses since then have been valid responses. There's again no need to dehumanize them; the only Jewish people they've had contact with are the Israeli Jews who've been absolutely terrible to them. Of course they chant these things! 

To imply their reactions are just stemming from some evil racism is a very shallow analysis of the situation.

No, nation states in the region wouldn't have intervened anyway. A couple of reasons for that:

* Israel has nukes, they do not.
* It takes a considerable amount of time to build up for an invasion.
* None of the Arab armies can take on the IDF and while they are very inept, they know that much.
* They have more to lose than to gain from attacking Israel directly.

Religion. Islam is what Hamas uses to order the Palestinians around. They use allah’s words, Mohammad’s words, all written and documented. They don’t need to make it up. Islam is antisemitic. It teaches muslims that jews are not their friends. It asks muslims to start “jihad” against the “enemies of god” . Tells them in detail that war for this land will stay till the end of time, until muslims kill every last jew.

Hamas preaches these words of allah, over and over. They say Israel wants to tear down al Aqsa, for 38 years i have heard this.. nothing’s getting touched.. yet they keep saying the same lie and people get triggered. They call Palestinians the “ only arabs fighting for the honor of the muslim nation “. Reminds them that if and when they die for this “cause” they go straight to heaven, no questions asked. Like they hold the keys.

Notice every mother’s reaction to her slayn children in Gaza.. she says “nothing’s too much for god and al Aqsa”. They truly believe, poor naive things, that they are living the word of allah.. waiting for the time he allows them to finally beat the jews.

It’s ridiculous. It’s worse than hypnosis. They are completely blind to any logic outside of what they’ve been consistently hearing from the day they were born. 

You know how I know that this is 100% true?

My own parents have these exact thoughts. Luckily we don’t live there. And more lucky for me that I have the brains to not fall for that hypnosis.",0

k6y34bm,"I've given your question some thought. Here's my understanding of the situation, and I'll break this down into three reasons:  
1. Why I don't think that the Israeli government is generally interested in any escalation:  
A. This isn't in Bibi's interest - the Israeli PM for decades has been running on two platforms. He is sold as Mr. Security and Mr. Finance.  The way the former is measured by, is (quite literally) the number of Israeli deaths due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. News outlets often run [comparisons between PMs](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001407799) by looking at [Israeli deaths as as criterion for measuring effective governance](https://natunbarosh.co.il/%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95-%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90-%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C/) (obviously, the less death, the better).   
B. This isn't in the coalition's interest - the past year in Israel has been marked by the judicial reform and the entire coalition has been geared towards ensuring the passing of this legislation. Members of the Knesset spent time, money and resources campaigning in favour and against this issue. This was going to be Bibi's big win and a lot was riding on the success of this law. I don't think that the coalition was interested in a military escalation at all, as all the funds, energy and efforts were directed elsewhere for a very long time.  
2. Even if you don't buy into the first point, I don't think that the Israeli government is interested in this scale of an escalation:  
A. A lot of the areas that were hit, are key agricultural points in Israel, directly affecting food supplies and agricultural exports.  
B. Terrorists have made it into secure and highly protected bases, almost stealing extremely classified information (it is clear that this was the intention.  
C. Blatant murder of hundreds of any Israeli is a mark of Cain on any Israeli politicians. You can see how well Olmert faired after the second Lebanon war and operation Cast Led, and how Golda went down in history after her fiasco. This extent marks not only the political death of Bibi, but of all involved.   
D. This isn't a popular point in this sub, but Israel really does value its citizens life. Gilad Shalit's exchange for over 1000 Palestinians is a good example of this.  
E. Israel has extensive programs to support families of anyone who has been hurt, killed or murdered at the hands of terror. The sheer number of casualties from the past three weeks are going to require a lot of financing, once all of this is over.   
3. Even if both points are untrue, why this specific escalation was not one that the Israeli government was interest in:  
A. The Israeli military was wholly unprepared for this - the bases were understaffed, equipment wasn't ready and the air force took 6 hours to respond. No one thought that this was going to happen.  
B. Multiple security staff took responsibility for this - from all military high ranking and relevant officers to the Shin Bet and everyone else. From  strategic perspective, once this whole thing is over, Israeli is going to lose a generation of security personnel due to their negligence. It's not just the 1400 victims - it's the loss of everyone who is going to take responsibility and leave.  
C. The military was just unprepared from the number of reserve recruits - people were drafted while equipment was missing and bases were unprepared.  
If the government was interested in this level of escalation, it would have saved faced by embracing the conflict well. But it was wholly unprepared.  
So what could be an explanation? [I think that this piece explains and outlines things well enough](https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/yokra13636031) \- Google translate can help in understanding the details. Bottom line - October 7th will remain as a dark mark on Israel's leadership, sovereignty and and sense of security.",0

Some times it takes a few years and there's peace between warring nations, other times it could take centuries but eventually humans get tired of hate and just make peace. However with this one, it's deeper than just land. I know many will be upset with me to say it, but It's so clearly more than just Palestine. Arab nations might have to do some soul searching on this issue. All parties tbh.",0

k6y1p3j,"In America we have half the country split but the right tends to be more extreme because of religion and many who are overtly racist probably do to less education and the fact that republican leaders like to pretend minorities have it better than white people. The left also does the same abs ignores poor people if they are white. But the right pretends Leftism is what the left mostly believes and it’s not. Most are progressives at most. Usually leftists are younger people in a phase. Kind of the same as the alt right but the alt right became much more legitimate because of Trump. 

But both sides are really run by corporations and special interests. The left by Pharma and Tech, the right by Pharma, weapons and oil. But the Zionist lobby has a real stranglehold on both sides although most Jewish Americans are on the left as liberals and aren’t even as crazy about Israel as Christians on the right. 

Also Jewish people can speak out more easily because you can’t call a Jewish person antisemitic with the same weight. So me being Palestinian American realize that people like Noam Chomsky are in a really good position to speak against Zionism without the baggage of being shut down and called racist against Jews. 

In England there has been a lot of push to make anti Israel or anti Zionism be equal to antisemitism to really stop all criticism of israel does. Has this happened in a lot of Europe. I always thought America had an unusual an stranglehold by the Zionist lobby but I guess Europe is the same in many ways. 

But to be fair from any point of view I think the Arabs in general really messed up and played right into the hands of Zionists by becoming more religious. Now there is a huge split and many Arabs became less religious and more educated but the far right religious groups like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt got elected. And those are the same people the Hamas originally came from who get funding from isrsel because they want more extremists to say they are justified in what they do to Palestinians and what they get Americans to vote for in their foreign policy. 

But when people are poor, uneducated because there is a more powerful group exploiting them it’s hard not to go to religion more because it’s all you have left sometimes. But Palestinians have actually had a good education system, mostly because it’s the one good thing the British did when they controlled it, so I don’t get why they cling to it as hard. At least in Gaza it’s more understandable but the West Bank has to focus on education to get out of this mess and use it to create wealth and influence before Isrsel takes all of the land that’s left. 
Gaza on the other hand is really tough because it’s literally a prison and without Hamas they would’ve probably stole half of their land like the West Bank but Hamas is also the excuse israel uses to do what they do. So I feel horrible for the people because they are screwed either way and Hamas is now underground in their tunnels while isrsel bombs the civilians on top.

What good is that America is send special forces to help isrsel. I hope this backfires because many Americans are wondering why we are sending our own people and billions to die for this fascist country. I hope people wake up to this. 

Ultimately politics in America is about how to move tax money to the people that help you win your elections with their donations. So America says we need to help Ukraine abs they take billions of our tax money to buy weapons from Americans manufacturers and give them to Ukraine. Now these weapons guys get super wealthy and in turn they bankroll the next election for the ones who supported this. America knows our people are sick of wars so instead they are trying to proxy wars indirectly now.",1

The current immediate plan would be to weaken Hamas. 

Israel isn't stupid enough to think that Hamas can be completely eradicated by any military action - but that doesn't make a military action pointless.

The attacks on October 7th showed that Hamas had far more military capability and were a far larger threat than Israel ever thought. Israel simply cannot let that threat remain. 

Hamas *existing* is a secondary problem.

Hamas having the capabilities to invade and kill more than a thousand civilians and being an real threat is a primary problem, that needs to be addressed *right now*. Israel simply cannot afford to let Hamas continue being a threat on that level. 

Hence the current military action. 

Yes, you won't be able to bomb Hamas out of existence - but every bombed Hamas weapon cache mean less weapons Hamas can aim at Israeli civilians *right now*. Every Hamas soldier killed mean one less animal prepared to go into a Israeli town to rape and butcher civilians *right this moment*. Every Hamas tunnel bombed makes it harder for Hamas to operate *right now*... and so on.

Hamas might get more weapons from Iran in the future, might regrow their numbers, and might rebuild their tunnels and bunkers - but that's things that's years down the line. Those are long term problems that Israel will have to try finding a solution for eventually - but right now they have an immediate threat that has to be dealt with, right now.",0

https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-health-ministry-health-death-toll-59470820308b31f1faf73c703400b033

and, “In the aftermath of war, the U.N. humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records.

In all cases the U.N.'s counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza Health Ministry’s, with small discrepancies.

— 2008 war: The ministry reported 1,440 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 1,385.

— 2014 war: The ministry reported 2,310 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 2,251.

— 2021 war: The ministry reported 260 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 256.

While Israel and the Palestinians disagree over the numbers of militants versus civilians killed in past wars, Israel’s accounts of Palestinian casualties have come close to the Gaza ministry’s. For instance, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians — just a bit lower than the ministry’s toll.”

 - another witness (woman) said on Israeli TV, that Hamas came to her house where she and two of her children were - they immediately told her not to worry and and to sit with her children. She said that they were looking around the house for weapons (her guess). when they did not find any they left - on the way out one of them asked her if he can take a banana from her table and she said ""yes""

 - so they were not there to kill civilians - most of the civilians died in shootout between Israeli soldiers and Hamas - or some civilians who were carrying weapons were killed because they were presenting danger (only settlers of kibbutzim are allowed to have weapons in Israel and most of them do)

She details two tank shells being fired into the home by the Israeli Defense Forces where there were no survivors among the hostages or the kidnapped. In my shock and HORROR I realize the return of the Hannibal Doctrine.

This is why Yocheved Lifshitz’s interview once releases is so important as she details her treatment was “nothing like they say on TV they provided medical treatment (makes sense they need them alive), the same food, women’s hygiene, and didn’t abuse them.

There are plenty of Christian Palestinians who feel the same way about Israel as the Muslim Palestinians. They're right to. Their land was stolen from them! 
I understand Israelis are annoyed and shocked that the local Arab population can't get over it, but it's their right not to get over it. That does not mean they're out to get Jews. Hating someone for what they're *doing* is NOT the same as hating someone for their ethnic background.",1

Many others left because they were in a war zone started by the Arabs.
How many soldiers were assigned to displacing hundreds of thousands of people? You do realize that this takes a large organization to do so. The Jews were too busy defending themselves and their country for this supposed task force that has no evidence of ever existing.
There were bands of both Jewish and Arab soldiers that terrorized each others smaller villages. Most Jews were fighting a three front war against 10x their numbers.  
Cities like Haifa which had 65000 people in 1947 was found deserted by the Israelis in 1948. There were multiple journalists who documented this in 1948.

k6xy7q1,"The article discusses recent developments in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The key points mentioned are:

1. Senior Hamas political leadership member Ali Barakeh stated that they did not anticipate a significant response from the US after Hamas attacked Israel.

2. The US provided considerable support to Israel during its conflict with Hamas, which took Hamas by surprise.

3. The US sent a carrier strike group, featuring the USS Gerald R. Ford, closer to Israel and considered sending additional military assets, such as a second aircraft carrier and fighter jets.

4. Later, the US sent Lt.-Gen. James Glynn, a three-star US Marines general, and other military officers to assist Israel in planning its ground offensive into Gaza.

5. Iran, which supports Hamas, has noticed the increased US support for Israel and has issued threats in response.

6. US forces in the region have recently been targeted by Iran-backed militia.


theories and reasons why Hamas might not have anticipated such a significant response from the US:

1. **Historical US Stance**: Historically, while the US has been a staunch ally of Israel, it has not always directly intervened militarily in Israel's conflicts with Hamas. Thus, Hamas might have assumed that the US would maintain its traditional diplomatic and financial support role without direct military involvement.


2. **Domestic Politics**: Hamas might have believed that the current US administration would be more hesitant to involve itself directly due to potential domestic political repercussions. Every administration's approach to the Israel-Palestine issue can vary based on its political inclinations, the national mood, and its foreign policy goals.


3. **Shift in Global Power Dynamics**: The global political landscape has been evolving, with powers like China and Russia asserting themselves more. Hamas might have anticipated that the US would be more preoccupied with these larger geopolitical issues and less likely to focus on the Israel-Hamas conflict.


4. **Miscalculation**: It's entirely possible that Hamas simply miscalculated the extent to which the US would go in supporting Israel this time around. Military and political strategies often involve a series of predictions and assumptions, and not all of them turn out to be accurate.


5. **Symbolic Attacks**: Hamas might have believed that their attacks would be seen more as symbolic resistance rather than a direct challenge warranting significant international intervention.


6. **Deterrence Strategy**: From Hamas's perspective, launching attacks might be a strategy to galvanize their base, assert their dominance in Palestinian politics against rivals like Fatah, and draw international attention to their cause. They might not have anticipated that this would lead to such a strong US response.


7. **Diplomatic Channels**: Hamas might have received indications, through back channels or other diplomatic means, that led them to believe the US response would be more muted.",1
